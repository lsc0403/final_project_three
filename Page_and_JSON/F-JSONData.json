            "Review": "I love Back to the Future. While having a typical 80s feel to it, which I like, I love how fun, irresistible and original the film is. The special effects are dazzling and the comedy is suitably sly and sophisticated. Helping along the way is a script that is pretty ingenious, the sort of script that has quotable lines and also pokes fun at 1950s icons and lifestyles during the frequent bouts of time travelling. The score by Alan Silvestri elevates the sense of fun to a greater level, the main theme is one of the most memorable themes ever in the history of film, or so I think anyway. Robert Zemekis's direction is very good, and the cinematography, scenery and costumes are also excellent. And I have to mention the acting, Michael J Fox is really appealing in the role of Marty McFly, the role that propelled him to stardom, and Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in one of his most memorable roles(and yes this includes Judge Doom from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and Professor Plum from Clue). Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are also great. Overall, brilliant film that is good in so many ways. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

            "Review": "Back To The Future is such an inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking that it is impossible to forget about it. The casting of every character involved was absolutely perfect, and the performances were spectacular. I first saw this film when I was six years old, and it is the only movie that I know of that I don't think I could ever get sick of.\nOne of the best things about Back To The Future is that it really makes you think. You can have in-depth conversations about the plausibility of the story-line and spend hours discussing the film. The story is awesome, it is delivered cleverly and entertainingly, and the movie as a whole is just so much FUN that it can be forgiven whatever number of time-travel discrepancies that may be found in the plot. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I have never found a movie other than this one that provides such a huge dose of great fun, and it has the desirable quality where you are able to see something new each time you see it. The only problem is that they stopped at part III."

            "Review": "One of the last movies I went with sister to see back in 86. The film blew my mind. My friends never wanted to see this one. I was happy I went. Many year's latter, I bought \"Back to the Future\" at Mc Donalds for $2.99 or for some other low price with a meal. The film ages well, and I love it just the same. The director and screen writer mixes science fiction, humor, and action perfectly. A big component of the script is time line theory which drives the story. Marty has many problems to fix, and finds out more than anyone wants to know about their parents. Michael J Fox and Christopher Loyd were excellently casted. Marty and Doc what a chemistry. With the film series one see the many dualities with time travel, that become a constant with the movie. The town clock, being awoke in a strange place, and letters. Keep this in mind when watching the 2 other sequels. The theory that time repeats itself is evident. What a time machine, the Delorian adds to this movie. Worth watch over again. 10 out of 10! Thank you TBS for showing all 3 films."

            "Review": "What can I say about this movie that was already said? It is my favorite time travel sci-fi, adventure epic comedy in the 80's and I love this movie to death! When I saw this movie I was thrown out by its theme. An excellent sci-fi, adventure epic, I LOVE the 80s. It's simple the greatest time travel movie ever happened in the history of world cinema. I love this movie to death, I love, LOVE, love it! I firstly saw this movie in the early 90's as a kid on VHS tape and I was blow away by the action and the score and the title back to the future. This movie is one of the best masterpiece time travel epic adventure film. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fantastic at acting. Music theme score by Alan Silvestri is excellent I could listen to it whole day.Back to the Future (1985) From the Academy Award \"- winning team of Steven Spielberg\" and Robert Zemeckis** comes the hilariously groundbreaking adventure that thrilled critics and audiences alike - and sparked one of the most successful movie trilogy ever! Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movie begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. His ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). But things went wrong when scientist Dr. Emmett Brown/Doc (Christopher Lloyd) wanted Marty's assistance for his new invention.At that night Marty went to assist Doc's invention the Time traveling Car \"DeLorean\". Marty was told to record Doc's first time travel to the future. At that instant they were attacked by some Libyan terrorists who were cheated by Doc for Plutonium.After killing Doc they turn towards to Marty and without any intention Marty enters the Time Traveling car. But it was previously set by Doc and when activated Marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.What will he do next, will he can come back to the future, or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. More than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? Dealing with time travel and time paradox Steven Spielberg presents this amazing journey of Marty set up in the time of 80's and 50's. Scripted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the story of Bob Gale himself, tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.They really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling, culture clashed family movie. A good story with a great script. Also the soul of the movie was given by the legend Alan Silvestri. His composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. Over the top the theme music, it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.More than that the casting was simply brilliant, each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. Michael J. Fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic Marty McFly, which was considered for numerous actors. Also Thomas F. Wilson was brilliant in his performance as the Bad boy Biff Tannen. Lea Thompson did a great work in portraying Lorraine Baines's two different life times, as a teenage girl and a matured mother. Well the extra talented Christopher Lloyd had almost \"chewed every scenes\" in the movie. Mr. Lloyd's versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist Dr. Emmett Brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.Last but not the least, it was Crispin Glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as George McFly. It was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. Crispin Glover lived in that part. I don't know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance. Above all I want to remember this as a romantic movie and it couldn't be made without the songs \"The Power of Love,\" and \"Earth Angel\".The rating I am giving is 10/10 the original and the best one of all time. I love this film, it is my favorite time travel movie of all time and I love it to death! All in all it is the greatest sci-fi, romantic movie of all time. It is the part of the great Movie History, which consider itself as \" A Modern/Classic Masterpiece! \""

            "Review": "My DVD of Back To The Future is like my own personal time machine: I hit play on the remote and I'm instantly whisked back to 1985, when hair was big, fashion was fugly, films were fun and I was a mere 17 years of age with my whole adult life ahead of me.Nostalgia certainly plays a big part in my continued enjoyment of the film, and was clearly at the forefront of the minds of producer Steven Spielberg and director Robert Zemeckis, who delight in recreating the 50s of their youth, but the film is much, much more than a simple trip down memory lane: it's a rollicking adventure, a charming love story, and a brilliant comedy, with a career-defining performance from Michael J. Fox as time-travelling teen Marty McFly, fine support from the lovely Lea Thompson, quirky Crispin Glover and crazy Christopher Lloyd, amazing special effects (for the time) from ILM, and a rocking 80s soundtrack.A wonderful film that is as fresh and entertaining today, despite its inescapable 80s style, I have no doubt that Back To The Future will continue to captivate audiences young and old well after my generation is history: my kids sure loved it, and I hope that when they have kids of their own, theirs will too. And theirs, and theirs, and theirs..."

            "Review": "I admit to having grown up on 1980s films and thus having a special admiration for them. Whichever way you look at it, BACK TO THE FUTURE is one of the most intelligent of the Hollywood blockbusters from that era, a film which perfectly merges crowd-pleasing entertainment with a complex and well-written storyline that gets to grips with the thorny subject of time travel.The underrated Michael J. Fox stars in the role of his life as Marty McFly, a guy who unwisely gets involved in time travel thanks to the machinations of his kooky inventor buddy, Doc Brown. Christopher Lloyd essays this subsidiary character and, again, it's the role of his life; he's over the top in it but nonetheless his character is thoroughly endearing and never less than hilarious.The time travel aspects of the storyline are carefully worked out and hold together very well even today, some 30 years after release. What I particularly liked about this film is the calibre of the writing: there's no slow spots or simplicity here, just one suspenseful sub-plot after another. There are small moments, big set-pieces, cutting edge special effects, action, chase scenes, romance, and of course plenty of humour, and a quirky supporting cast who make the most of their roles. BACK TO THE FUTURE is a classic - and for good reason."

Fox) is accidentally sent thirty years into the past in a time-traveling DeLorean invented by his friend, Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), and must make sure his high-school-age parents unite in order to save his own existence.After almost thirty years (2014), this film loses none of its charm, and actually gains respect. The movie has had such a strong impression on everyone, whether they have seen it or not, as it completely permeated pop culture.The script is genius, not only how it parallels 1955 and 1985 (some of the references are dynamite), but how it set the scene for the sequels (despite allegedly not intending to have any). This is just one clever gag after another, and may require repeated viewings to catch them all."

            "Review": "Back to the future is the ultimate 1989's movie, if you're feeling nostalgic, or simply want to experience the flavour of the decade, then this is the movie for you.A young Michael J Fox is sent back to 1955 by his friend, Dr Emmett Brown, his very existence threatens his own future, he has to fight for life as he knows it.It's super fast paced, it's one of those movies that simply flies by, it's fully of action, full of laughs, it's very much the 80's poking fun at the 50's, the free and carefree lifestyle of 1985 showing how things have changed in three decades.Wonderful special effects, lots of pyrotechnics and action sequences to enjoy. The music is wonderful, you'll be singing along.The acting is superb, Michael J Fox is just great as Marty, Christopher Lloyd is awesome as the wild eyed Doc.I would say it's the perfect Boxing Day film, but it's one of those awesome movies that you'll enjoy any time, and with the whole family.A fabulous movie.10/10."

I loved the chemistry between Doc Brown and Marty McFly, I loved the all too familiar soundtrack and the ridiculous way in which George McFly laughs. This movie has become such a nostalgic and feel-good film for me. I had the good fortunate to see all three 'Back to the Future' movies in cinema last year and it was such an experience to watch this timeless classic with people who enjoy this film as much as I do. Everyone has to see this film at least once in their life! Such an amazing, funny Sci-Fi from the 1980's. I just can't get enough of this movie - it will just never get old. Cannot recommend it enough!"

Ha ha! I'm back on track! Well, obviously, this is my first review for the first Back to the Future and when I came her to IMDb, I knew this was a well loved movie, I was just amazed at it being on the top 250, but I can't give it a lower rating because Back to the Future was an excellent film that was ground breaking for it's time and still today.Marty McFly and his good friend, The Doc, are two science nuts. Marty isn't really happy with his home life and the fact that he and his parents are very square and strict, The Doc calls Marty and shows him his latest invention, his De Lauren that he built into a time machine. When the government go after The Doc and Marty has to get away, he jumps in the car and goes back to the year of 1955, when his parents met. Instead of the way his mom and dad met happening to his dad, he ends up being in the position and mom ends up falling for her son, not even knowing! But he has to make sure his parents are together in time so he can get back without altering the future.Back to the Future to this day is still a timeless treasure that I notice more and more is becoming part of a newer generation. Michael J. Fox should be proud, his work will be remembered for a long time. Back to the Future worked so well because of the great story and the humor was great, the whole cast worked together and made a terrific movie that will be looked back on thirty years from now and still be considered cool.10/10"

A whimsical but very clever time travel story that bedazzles you leaving you wanting more.The charasmatic Michael J Fox plays a wonderful bumbling high schooler searching for love, a guitar gig and his existence which he himself threatens to erase.Clever and humourous references litter this fun flick; references which are further improved upon in the sequels. Views of the same scenes from different angles, different perspectives and different timelines abound.Fun for the entire family."

            "Review": "Synchronize your watches! If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88mph, you're gonna see some serious s***. Directed & written by Robert Zemeckis, this movie will forever remind me of what good-feel movie is supposed to be. The movie is about a teenager from 1985, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) whom is sent back in time to 1955. While, he was there, he meets his future parents in high school and accidentally becomes his mother, Lorraine (Lea Thompson)'s romantic interest, causing a time-rip. Marty must repair the damage to history by trying to get his parents to fall in love, and with the help of scientist Dr. Emmett \"Doc\" Brown (Christopher Lloyd), while, also finding a way to return to 1985. I love the fish out of water history time-travel comedy, with the high-stakes action scenes. It was very entertaining. I love how the film has its running gags, and inside jokes of historical pop culture events; of Robert Zemeckis's work, and what was happening in the 1980s at the time. The movie has everything for every audience member, at the time. While, most movies were risqu\u00e9 and adult-aimed at the time; this movie balance it, enough to make it watchable for both family and single house-hold settlings. Parents went to go see it for nostalgia reasons. While the movie is mostly set in 1950's, it's truly a mark of the 1980's. I have to give the movie props with its controversial movie dilemma, with the Oedipal relationship with his mother. In any other movie, this might be tasteless, and turn people off, but Back to the Future made it work. I can also buy that, teenager Marty McFly would be friends with an older mad scientist, Doc Brown without it being creepy. Both have this father/son relationship that I love from this film. Mad praise to Christopher Lloyd for creating this character for his own. I can't see, anybody besides him. The production was indeed challenging. There were some changes that help the film, a lot. First off, is the title of the film, the film was almost call, 'Spaceman from Pluto'. Gladly, somebody came to their senses, and went back into the title, 'Back to the Future'. Another is that, while, Michael J. Fox was the first choice to play Marty McFly, but he was committed to the show Family Ties. So they hired Eric Stoltz. I wouldn't say, Eric Stoltz would be awful in the movie, but indeed, Michael J Fox was the best choice for the film and they wait on production, until Fox's schedule opened up. The supporting cast is well-acted. Crispin Glover that played George McFly got all George's nerdy mannerisms, right. Lea Thompson is just amazing, and beautiful actress to play Lorraine McFly. Thomas F. Wilson as the bully, Biff Tannen was just hilarious. Every scene with him, made the film, so much better. You'll love to hate him. The set use for the film is one of the most famous movie backlot, previously being used in such works as 1962's To Kill a Mocking Bird, 1960's Inherit the Wind, and others works. The movie had a pretty good pace. There weren't a lot of slow or boring moments. Maybe, the beginning, it does take them, forever to get the time travel part of the film. Eight minutes were cut, including Marty watching his mom cheat during an exam, George getting stuck in a telephone booth and Marty pretending to be Darth Vader. Thank God, they cut the 'Nuking the Fridge' idea. An early draft of the Back to the Future script saw Marty travelling through time in a fridge and being caught in a nuclear bomb detonation. Spielberg would later use this in 2008's Indiana Jones & Kingdom Skull. Zemeckis almost cut out the \"Johnny B. Goode\" sequence as he felt it did not advance the story, but the preview audience loved it, so it was kept. The visual/special effects are just ground-breaking for the time, and it's just beautiful to watch. The opening scene, flawlessly sets up the film's central themes of time and space, provides heaps of exposition. The music by Alan Silvestri is emotional, epic and intense music. It's give the feel of two friends alone, fighting alone against two of the greatest forces ever know to humanity; time and fate. About Huey Lewis and the News, \"The Power of Love\". It's a product of its time. It doesn't hurt or help the film. It's just there. I do love the 'Earth Angel' song. It's romantic as hell. There are some nitpicks that I could focus on, like the time-travel plot-holes, but trying to understand the logic of all the time travel paradoxes, would take you out of the movie, and give you a headache. It's not worth it. Still, how his parents never find out that Marty McFly look like the kid, Calvin Klein from their childhood? Other faults of the movie are, the Pepsi product placement and its over used clich\u00e9s. The movie also one of those films that would audience would see anything in it, as people see symbolism from 9/11 tragedy, JFK assassination conspiracy, Aliens, and others. Others see the film, themes taken from ancient and spiritual myths such as Kronos vs Zeus, the Bible, and others. One thing, it did influence is the skateboarding culture. The movie occurred during the 1980s infancy of the skateboarding sub-culture. The film was such a success, that it create two sequels, 1989's 'Back to the Future Parts II' and 1990's 'Back to the Future Park III'. It also create an animated series, theme park ride, several video games and a forthcoming musical. As with all great movies, Back to the Future, has stood the test of time. It never gets old. Overall: Power up the DeLorean, turn the time circuits on and get the flux capacitor! Where we're going, we don't need roads."

            "Review": "Back to the Future is one of those rare, almost forgotten, pieces of pop culture that, surprisingly, draws little attention to itself.  Unlike such notable gimmicks as Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jaws, and Independence Day, there aren't any low-budget leeches trying to imitate off this work and cash-in on its success. This is due to the near flawless script.  Why it didn't win an Oscar, you're guess is as good as mine.  Making a time-travel storyline as in this movie that doesn't fall into plot holes the size of Terminator's is exceptionally difficult.  I'd know.The film starts slow, and gradually accelerates as it progresses.  You could almost call it a Jerry Bruckheimer movie for kids with Spielberg's trademark nostalgia.  The characters themselves are typical stereotypes for a movie like this and none of them, not even Marty himself, gel with potential.  In some ways it's as if MAD magazine made the film in an attempt to be serious.With such an automotive obsession as this film has, one must wonder if George Lucas was involved.Overall, I have to praise this movie for its inventiveness and originality, even if it created most of our time-travel cliches.  4 out of 5 stars.

I did that without checking ether which proves that I've seen this movie WAY to many times in a week (6 times to be exact). Lets get to the plot.It's about a kid who gets sent to the past, accidentally stop his parents falling in love and seducing his mum? Creepy.Real talk time!!!! (A time when I talk about whats good/bad about a movie) The Cajigger: (main plot item) it is the DeLorian the coolest time vehicle ever made. 88/100The feel: this move irradiates 80s' it has the cool guitarist, it has the girls with weird hair, it has the teen which just wants to rock 'n' roll... PARTY ON.The Doc: he is the equivalent of mixing Dr Frankenstein, Mel Brooks and Dr Evil. You get the idea. A funny, crazy scientist. It's as epic as it sounds.This movie is easily the best time travel movie and even the best movie ever made.don't do yourself a disservice and not watch it. GO WATCH IT."

            "Review": "I feel that there is no such thing as a perfect film,but in today's cinema,\"Back to the Future\" comes amazingly close.It has laughs, AND thrills,always a great combination.I am amazed at the attention paid to nearly every single detail here.For example,at the start of the film,Doc and Marty are in the parking lot of the \"Twin Pines Mall\".Then,shortly after Marty arrives in 1955,he accidently runs over one of old man Peabody's beloved pine trees.Toward the end, after Marty returns,the name of the mall changes.This is something you just don't notice until you see the film several times as I have. Excellent casting,particularly Christopher Lloyd as the unforgettable Doc Brown,the humor of the Ronald Reagan bit and the Johnny B. Goode sequence,along with the ultimate heart pounding ending and the attention to detail as I mentioned make this film as close to perfect as you will see in modern cinema.The sequels? Forget them.This is the only one of the trilogy you need to see."

By the end of the film, I was only thinking, \"Wow, Hollywood was once capable of putting magic on the screen.\" It really makes you wonder if the best of Hollywood is behind us.To summarize a few components of the movie: The storyline and plot are superb, even with the minor plot holes. The acting is spot on in every scene. Today's film editors should watch this film a hundred times to see what editing should really be like, nearly flawless. The direction is unbelievable in my opinion. The screen writing and script are perfect as well and will make you laugh and smile throughout the movie. Every line by the awkward McFly family, every crazy rumbling of \"Doc\", and even the cheesy bully taunts of Biff fit together so well.When I sat down to watch this movie a few days ago, I expected to see an aged movie that I remembered being much better than it actually was. I'm so glad I was wrong."

            "Review": "When you talk about Back to the Future, you have to talk about the whole trilogy. Because Zemeckis and Gale didn't make sequels they extended the length of one film, which is very different than a sequel.The ultimate film must allow the audience feel part of the film and relate to the characters. This film is the best because it takes a fantasy story and makes it adaptable to real-life. I don't know how soon anyone will be able to time-travel, but you can relate to Marty McFly's (Michael J. Fox) reaction to the change. Even if you're not a teenager you can believe it in someway. Back to the Future is the perfect and its been extended into a masterpiece with 2 sequels or extensions as I see it. Definitely a must see, if your pathetic enough not to have seen in at least the last 8 years.Amazing story by Gale and Zemeckis. Great acting especially by Michael J. Fox, but also great work by Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and Tom Wilson. Such an exciting an involved story."

            "Review": "Lots of tongue in cheek. Some great characterization. A chance at redemption. These movies showed Michael J. Fox to be a wonderful comedic presence. It is sad what happened to him, but can there be a more impressive example of a person who has overcome the tribulations that life has given him. Whenever I see him in \"The Good Wife\" as the slimy, underhanded character lawyer he plays, I love that I can \"not like\" a man who is dealing with devastating Parkinson's. As the principle character in this movie, Marty is shoved from one situation to another in a time he only can guess at. He has to face the youth of his father, a febrile wimp who gets pushed around. Then, of course, there is the wonderful Christopher Lloyd as the professor. While one could never accuse this film of being true science fiction with all the implications of time travel, there is a kind of suspense that works very well. It's pure fun and is the best of the three films in my opinion."

It's hard say why this movie is so great, or why it still looks as good as it does, even by modern standards (don't forget this is 20 years old) but if it has escaped your viewing then just see it as soon as possible and i'll bet you'll want to see the rest of the trilogy the second you finish watching it.I think it's just entertainment in its purist form.A big 9/10"

            "Review": "Such an amazing film that deserves the accolades and acclaimed hype it's garnered. One of the best foreign language films there is and one of the best films personally seen recently, after a long time of being on my to see list but taking a while to get round to it due to being so busy and going through a difficult phase.Perhaps 'City of God' is not for everybody. It is not some audience members' idea of being entertaining, and is pretty unflinching, uncompromising and challenges the viewer. It does, with that being said, a superlative job bringing those qualities to life, and there are others, including myself, who judge films by what they set out to do rather than just wanting to be \"entertained\". There are many hugely entertaining films, while there are others that are clearly intended to be things other than entertainment and either are deep character studies, deliberate mood pieces and poignant dramas and shouldn't be denounced because of stereotypical views of what a film should be like.'City of God' is very well made, with some stunning and hard-hitting images, even if the budget is not high or enormous. It's all audaciously shot and edited with a lot of gritty atmosphere and sense of tension. The music fits well and has some haunting moments without being intrusive, while Fernando Meirelles's direction, particularly in the visual style, is superb.The story is not hard to follow, with lots of provoking thought, tension and emotion, while the action is positively explosive, frighteningly brutal and designed with a real meticulousness. In no way either does it glamorise crime and gives an unflinching view of gangland rivalry, provoking comparisons to Martin Scorsese and 'Goodfellas'.Alexandre Rodrigues and Leandro Firmino da Hora are fabulous in their roles and carry the film and their compellingly real characters adeptly.Overall, a masterwork. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

            "Review": "Cidade de Deus seems to have a lot of praise on the IMDb boards, and with good reason too. It simply is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary films ever made.Based on true events and characters who live in the overlooked and poverty stricken slums in the shadows of Rio de Janiero, where life expectancy doesn't reach the 30's and drug dealers are kings.The tale of the City of God, and its myriad of characters is told by Rocket, a young man who struggles to make something of his life, other than to wind up another victim of drugs or gang wars.Not only are the characters in City of God absolutely fascinating, and also very endearing, but also convincingly acted by groups of young and unknown actors. The stoies are well-told, and at times, funny, and at others, brutally shocking.The cinematic style of the film gives a nod to Tarantino, with some clever time-jumping, freeze-framing, and texts indicating another chapter of the film. In every sense, a bit of a Brazillian \"Pulp Fiction\" or \"Goodfellas\", but with its own unique flavour to it.The City of God is a marvel, and a highly recommended film to watch, but not recommended for the over-sensitive or easily distressed."

            "Review": "Do not be fooled by the coy charm of the promotional poster. The image of the girl shyly leaning over to kiss the cheek of a bare-backed boy on golden sands drenched in sunlight represents an ideal that many residents of the City of God strive for, but few achieve. The rewards are all too tangible: The football, the music, the heady culture of samba and carnival joie de vivre is never far away, but escaping from the slums of Rio is a little more complicated than sloping off to the beach for the afternoon. The City of God is a raging maelstrom of violence, drugs and gang warfare, and its inhabitants are indoctrinated in the way of the gun from an early age.Fernando Meirelles' film (based on a true story) is a breathtakingly convincing interpretation of life in the notorious Rio favela. Using hundreds of real-life slum children to supplement a superb central cast and shooting entirely around the dusty streets and abject poverty of the neighbourhood, Meirelles charts the history of the area through the narration of Rocket, a peaceable soul with journalistic aspirations who is entirely at odds with the mayhem around him.Rocket explains how the slum was used as a dumping ground for all Rio's undesirables in the 1960s. Despite a population of criminals and ne'er-do-wells, the early part of the film is an homage to plucky underdog cheeriness and community spirit. Rocket's brother is a member of the 'Tender Trio', a dashing group of bandits who go about brandishing pistols and holding up gas trucks like latter day highwaymen. Despite an elegant notoriety, the Trio's crimes tend to yield less than impressive fiscal reward, so they plan a heist on a motel-cum-knocking shop in an attempt to up the ante. It goes badly wrong. The gang's lily-livered tendencies mean they make a sharp exit at the first sniff of trouble but, unbeknownst to them, their lookout, unhappy with his passive role in proceedings (as bored nine-year-old little brothers are wont to be), strolls into the motel and fires at will, chortling psychotically as each hooker and john crumples to the floor.The kid in question is L'il Dice, a chubby Arnold-out-of-Diff'rent-Strokes lookalike with an insatiable lust for mayhem. The motel incident marks a shift in emphasis for the City of God and the following years see the slum descend into chaos as L'il Dice (later renamed L'il Ze) builds a narcotics empire by ruthlessly eliminating the competition. The streets become a recruiting ground for drug dealers and gang lieutenants. Small children (or 'runts' as they are affectionately known) come to see guns and criminal activity as the only viable rungs up the status ladder. 'I smoke, I snort, I've killed and robbed - I'm a man,' one prepubescent boy states defiantly.The film culminates in all-out war between L'il Ze's bunch of hoodlums and an idealistic group of insubordinates who throng behind the handsome Knockout Ned after he stands up to Ze's cruel regime. Meirelles is careful not to lionise Ned. Turning him into a hero figure would, I suppose, have romanticised a bitter and essentially futile conflict. Rocket, caught in the middle of the hostility highlights the ultimate irony: 'By the end, after years of fighting, nobody could remember how it all started,' he says. The war becomes the way of life in the favela. Being affiliated to one of the gangs gives the street kids credibility and, more importantly, access to weapons. Before long, guns are being handed out like lollipops, and the runts are running about excitedly firing their new 'toys' indiscriminately. It is the ultimate in power without responsibility.In their breathless exaltations, many reviewers have dubbed City of God 'Brazil's answer to Goodfellas'. It is a comparison that may be sound in terms of structure \u0096 Meirelles has certainly mastered Scorsese's canny editing and daring method of chronicling events over long periods of time \u0096 but overall this is a different beast. It is more of a Lord of the Flies with AK-47s. The most alarming aspect of all is the shocking lack of parental presence.This is essential in conveying the choices these street children have (or rather don't have). L'il Ze and his barbaric ilk become all these poor, impressionable little tykes have to aspire to. In short: they don't stand a chance \u0096 a fact sharply illustrated in one particularly distressing and almost unwatchable initiation scene where a young gang recruit is required to murder a cornered infant in order to appease his older colleagues.But Meireilles does not let this base, visceral tone swamp his movie. In Rocket he has an inspirational protagonist \u0096 the perfect foil to the madness and despair. His coming of age scenes where he bashfully attempts to flirt with girls and lose his virginity; and the sequence where he and his mate resort to petty crime only to bottle out when their intended victims turn out to be 'way too cool' to rob are the glue that holds the drama together. Without the light relief this would be intense and depressing fare.As it is, City of God is a triumph of story-telling: Magnificent, gut-wrenching and utterly compelling, it is cinema of the very highest order.Do not miss it.10/10"

The story is of the many young (pre and early-teen) criminals inhabiting an area just outside the big city of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. It has the feel of a documentary with real-life street kids but is upgraded considerably by fantastic camera-work, some very innovative cinematography. In other words: stylish.Make no mistake: without that stylish look, the film might be too much of a downer. The street kids are interesting but really brutal, so be prepared. I mean, how often do you see 12-year-old killers portrayed on film? The violence, language and drug use are rough in here and what a sad comment on this social problem in Brazil, a country with a huge problem with these street gangs. Overall, a very tough but fascinating film."

It's the randomness of the world. It beats with a human heart. It's a little messy. It's visceral. The kids are played by kids. The criminals are remorseless. The amateur actors are authentic.

It's not casual viewing, you need to concentrate, so ensure you have two peaceful hours to absorb it.Relentless, bleak, at times it's quite upsetting, if you're sensitive, this will leave a mark on you, several of the scenes which involve kids are quite hard to follow.Gun violence, drugs etc, it really doesn't hold back, it's graphic. The visuals for me are the film's best element, it looks terrific, it's very stylish.@The acting is terrific, especially when you consider the size of the cast, and the number of youths.10/10."

Actually, it's probably just about one of the best films I had ever seen.The characters really make this movie come alive with each of their compelling personalities shining though in the backdrop of oppressive conditions and constant violence. One thing which clearly comes to mind is \"Lil' Dice's\" ear to ear smile - so vivid and yet so ironic since he personifies pure evil.The City of God is a world you don't want to visit, it won't be featured on a post card, and it's said to be the city ignored by god himself. This movie makes you feel uncomfortable, puts you on the edge of your seat -- you are right into the middle of the City and you too are caught up in it's violent temptation. More importantly, it's about the triumph of the human spirit against all odds.This movie in effect is fast paced and hard to follow (with the added stress of subtitles over Portuguese), but it's worth it; and in fact really adds to the impetuous and impulsive undertones of the movie. In addition, the quintessential Brazilian music blending into the film like a well made Caprahina makes it feel authentic like the Italian music in the God Father.You see the flaws of these men played out in an almost fatalistic nature -- hated, greed, futility; and in it all we see ourselves, our own flaws, and our own condition."

Although I have not been into any \"favella\" (= ghetto) and I don't really know if the movie depicts it realistically, I do know that it is a gripping story. About kids growing up in a violent environment. Not that this movie is an action movie. It's a drama, with action scenes in it.The style and the look remind you a little bit of a documentary, just to make things scarier/real. It fully achieves it's goal. The \"actors\" (the director mostly used people who really live or lived in Brazilian ghetto) are superb too. And since the story is well written and told, there is nothing more you could wish for. Of course if watch it in it's original version and don't speak Portuguese, than you will have to read the subtitles ... but it's more than worth it (and I personally prefer it that way)"

            "Review": "The film, directed by Fernando Meirelles, tells the story of life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, in an area known as the Cidade De Deus, the City of God.  The story is told from the narration of the young photographer, Rocket.  The different scenarios of life that make up the wider-story are presented in Pulp Fiction style chapters, complete with on-screen titles for each different story component.  The story covers all the facets of the life, charting the growth of several key members of the gangs from childhood through to young adulthood, with their transformation from young hoodlums to local drugs barons.  The final parts of the story focus on the battle within the Cidade De Deus between two different groups, when business and personal matters lead to an unavoidable confrontation.  And what a confrontation it is, although details will not be given away here.  The result is a powerful telling of life based around real-life events.Martin Scorsese seems to have a heavy influence on the direction of this picture, with many moments looking familiar to fans of the legendary American filmmaker.  Close ups, sweeping scene shots, freeze-and-zoom shots, and a frenzied handheld approach are all trademarks that will be recognisably traceable to Scorsese, having been used throughout his career. Many shots remind the viewer of Scorsese's narrative dialogue-camera relationship in Goodfellas, in which the camera was used to brilliant effect to highlight the main points in the script.  This technique is used heavily in the first twenty minutes of Cidade De Deus, with the freeze frame trick being used to introduce the story's main characters alongside the dialogue of narrator, Rocket.Throughout the film one cannot help but watch a scene and think, 'I've seen that in Raging Bull, Goodfellas, or Casino', and this may make some look less favourably on the film's direction.  However, it is not fair to consider this 'a Brazilian Goodfellas', as one critic has observed.  The story has parallels - the underlying ideas of gangsters, drugs and violence -, the direction is similar, and the story is told with narration, much like Ray Liotta's role in Scorsese's epic.  But to regard this film in terms of what styles it repeats or nods it's hat to, is to be very ignorant. Fernando Meirelles,  has done a wonderfully hypnotic job of blending the old styles, and bringing them up to date with flashy and sometimes dangerously kinetic direction and editing.  Look only to the leaving-party scene in which strobe lighting is used to extraordinary effect, almost suffocating the story below a bombardment on the visual senses.  Think of a crossover between the visual energy of the Matrix and the violence of the club scene in Bad Boys.Cidade De Deus is much more than a directorial assault on the senses.  As Raul Walsh said if you don't have a story you have nothing, and many flashy Hollywood films have fallen short in using 'ultra-modern' direction to disguise the fact that no substantial story exists underneath.  Cidade De Deus is most brilliant in that it combines directorial and editorial brilliance with a story that is almost second to none in recent times. Only the true greats manage to cater to these two needs of cinema, and this is one that does.  The direction is amazing, but not to disguise the story flaws, and the story is brilliant, but does not overwhelm directorial originality.  But simply, Cidade De Deus is a perfect film for avid fans of cinematography, and those just in search of two hours of a bloody good story.I cannot decide yet if I would consider this better than Amores Perros, but it is certainly not inferior.  The at-the-same-time stylish and brutal visuals of Amores Perros are replaced by a grittier, more hands on approach to the subject.  Whilst in Amores Perros the characters took precedent, in Cidade De Deus the location is as big a character as those who live there. As a result we get a much greater feeling of the environment in which the characters exist, and so it is perhaps easier to empathise, and/or sympathise with them.  As the official press synopsis says, Cidade De Deus is a character, but is a place not a person.  Amores Perros triumphs in creating relationships between the audience and the characters, as it concentrates for a long time on relatively few people, each of whom we grow to know and ultimately care about, which is important for the emotional impact of the film.  Cidade De Deus deals with dozens, even hundreds, of characters, and so it is only a minority that we become attached to.  This means that while the film leaves a lasting impact we are not left with the same inquisitiveness about the future for the characters that we meet in Amores Perros.  Both films leave open ends, but Cidade De Deus feels closed. Whether you consider this a good or bad thing is a matter for personal choice.Cidade De Deus is essential viewing, and is cinema at its most brilliant. It will of course feel the wrath of critics who will dwell on the almost unimaginably high body count, but there are always those who will reject violence in the movies.  In fact the violence in Cidade De Deus, even the apocalyptic ending, is not as raw and bloody as many will expect.  Blood spilling is a rare sight, and the violence rests mostly, but not always, on choreography rather than in your face bloodshed.  The result is violence, but it is often so artistic that it looks beautiful rather than deterring. Like Scorsese's Taxi Driver the violence is abhorrent, but admirable from a cinematic perspective.In short, this is a superb achievement, and is easily one of the best films of the year, and of the decade so far.  Like it's predecessors, this is the latest film to come out of South America that indicates the emergence of major new talent in filmmaking.  Hollywood beware."

            "Review": "Wow, what a great movie! I'd heard plenty about this low budget Brazilian gangster film before I got around to seeing it when it showed on television in the middle of the night, but I was fully prepared to be disappointed. Many times a film has been hyped up so much that it's a let down when I finally see it, but not so this one: CITY OF GOD is a tremendous film, a masterpiece in fact. In many ways it's like a lower budget, more realistic version of the classic gangster films made by the likes of Martin Scorcese and Guy Ritchie and in many places it equals the heights of those two directors at the top of their game.The film follows the misadventures of various, almost feral children as they attempt to eke out an existence and then a living as they grow up in a Rio de Janeiro slum in the '60s, '70s and '80s. The central narrator isn't a gangster at heart; all he wants is to become a photographer and yet he's caught up time and time again in the violence surrounding his drug-dealing friends. Particularly good is Leandro Firmino as Li'l Ze, a psychotic hood who becomes a gang leader and who thinks nothing of having kids executed if they dare so much as get in his way.The direction is top notch, with Fernando Meirelles employing hand cameras on more than one occasion, so that this has a vivid, on the street look to it. The editing is slick and sleek, the music fits the action perfectly, and almost every actor seems to fit his or her role like a glove. I'm trying to think of things to criticise, but there's nothing, really: the story drew me in, got me interested in finding out what happened to the characters, and before I knew it a good two and a half hours had gone by while I sat back and was lost in this film's world. Of course, it's a tremendously violent movie, unflinching in its depiction of violence against children, and one of the most hard-hitting films I've witnessed, so not for those who prefer family-friendly fare; but if you're up for it, this just might be one of the best, most realistic crime films ever made."

            "Review": "The story begins in the present days, in a barbecue party in the slum of 'Cidade de Deus', with some bandits chasing a chicken. Then, a teenager called Buscap\u00e9 (Alexandre Rodrigues) tells the story of the Cidade de Deus and the main characters of the movie (Z\u00e9 Pequeno, Ben\u00e9, Cenoura etc.), since they were kids. This movie takes place in Cidade de Deus, a set of buildings originally built in the 60's for poor persons originated from a big flooding in Rio and from some slums. In the 60's, this area was isolated, without any infrastructure. Nowadays, with the construction boom, it is located close to Barra da Tijuca and Jacarepagu\u00e1, very valuables zones. Rio de Janeiro City is surrounded by slums, where the situation presented in the film is the reality of thousands and thousands of honest poor persons. This movie is remarkable: the screenplay, the direction, the performance of the cast, everything works perfectly. The frantic camera looks like a documentary. Today the DVD was released in Brazil, I bought it and I have just watched it with my family. I really can imagine the reaction of foreigners watching this sad side of Rio de Janeiro. It is strange, because a person who does not live in Rio probably may think that this movie exaggerates in some aspects. However, this is our reality. Lost bullets, robberies, violence is part of our day-by-day life. By the other hand, the same person may think that life in Rio 'stinks', and again it is not true. My city, like a golden coin, has two sides: heads and tails. If you can afford, you have wonderful places to live. But unfortunately, a great part of the population lives in slums, like the ones showed in this movie. The lack of perspective in life of the children, unemployment, ridiculous salaries, lack of education, lack of the faith, all of these factors contributes for the formation of the next generation of drug dealers and bandits. The traffic offers positions to the kids, like showed in this movie. And in the end, even when the 'grown-ups' are arrested or murdered, there is a bunch of children to occupy the spot. A sad social problem, but true. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"Cidade de Deus\" (\"City of God\")"

            "Review": "Before anyone says anything, hear me out. According to the IMDb Top 250 list, \"The Godfather\" reigns supreme as number one, while \"City of God,\" or more appropriately, \"Cidade de Deus,\" is at the number 17 slot. But to compare the two is like comparing an Arnold Schwartzenegger movie to \"Crash.\" They are just too different. But for me, while Francis Ford Coppolla's 1972 film is rightly considered a masterpiece, \"City of God\" is more memorable and packs a bigger punch. That, and \"The Godfather\" has had 30 more years under its belt to gather its legendary status. And it's in English (which, sadly, makes a lot of difference).Now, \"City of God.\" What a rush! Fernando Meirelles's masterpiece is a film to behold. Many critics have described films as \"explosive\" for the punch they pack, and/or the unflinching reality of the subject matter. But there has been no film I have ever seen that can match \"City of God\" for energy. It has so much energy that instead of unfolding, it throws itself at you all at once, leaving everything else to be done afterwards. The actors don't act; they don't have time. They just...are. Everything is done to such an extreme, it's surprising that Meirelles manages to make none of it sensationalistic or exploitative.Some people will tell you that this film is the chronicle of two drug lords. While there is some truth in that, the plot, if one could call it that, is better described as the chronicle of the \"City of God\" itself. Characters float in and out, with the \"out\" part frequently involving a bang (or more likely, a series of them). The characters are given background only if and when they are needed.Like I said, there's really no time to develop subtly-nuanced performances. The film moves with such breakneck energy that to do so would only slow it down. There are only a few characters that really matter. Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) is our window into the hellish slums. The result isn't voyeuristic, instead Rocket is more like a guide (albeit with only the narration addressing the audience). He's a normal teen, with interests in girls (particularly Angelica (Alice Braga)), sex, and aspirations to be a photographer. But his main goal is simply to survive each day. Also of note is Li' Ze, who we see growing up with a taste for violence as a kid (kids shoot and kill people just as frequently, if not more so, than adults). His increasingly drug-addled brain and his ambition makes him more frightening by the minute. The only one who keeps him grounded and (relatively) under control is Benny (Phellipe Haagensen), the \"coolest hood in the City of God.\" There's some truth in that statement, as spoken by Rocket. He's the shed of brightness in this hellish city (though he's no goody-two-shoes). Finally, there is Lil Ze's rival, Knockout Ned (Seu Jorge), who has the film's most notable character changes.But this is Fernando Meirelles movie. He throws in everything he can think of, and then some. References to Tarantino are abound, and there are probably more, but Meirelles takes the energy level up so high that there's no room for even a \"please\" or \"thank you.\" Desaturated colors. A constantly moving camera. Loud noises. An upbeat soundtrack (which is the film's saving grace from becoming too grim). It's all here.People may not agree with me that this is the best film ever made, and that's okay. I respect that. But make no mistake, it's an unforgettable 130 minutes."

            "Review": "The film revolves around the, 'City of God,' a favela (or ghetto) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a horrifying area where drug dealers run the community, and where children killing children is not an uncommon occurrence. The story begins with the early stages of the City of God (in the 1960's) showing where many of the problems stem from- the extreme poverty, overcrowding etc. Here, in the early stages of the favela, we meet our main characters, along with the supporting cast. The story revolves mainly around two characters living in the favela, Rocket and Lil Ze, and how they take two different paths through life. Rocket's dream is to become a photographer and to escape the City of God while Lil Ze becomes a powerful gang leader and drug dealer.The film offers an unflinching look at gang life in the City of God, as it follows the favela through three decades; the 60's, 70's and 80's, and shows how violence just spirals into more violence with the disturbingly high amounts of violence in the favela, most involving teenagers and children. The direction, cinematography, and editing are all Oscar-worthy. The cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen- with a very visceral, jerky feel, very reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan. The editing is very frantic, which makes you feel like you are on the streets of the City of God, and the direction is flawless, seamlessly blending the many elements of the story.The film was definitely one of the best films I have ever seen. The story, the direction, the cinematography, the editing and the acting all add up to make a excellent movie that I would recommend to all. 10/10, A+Would also recommend: Bus 174 and Carandiru"

            "Review": "There are many films that don't live up to the hype they are afforded, particularly modern day films. 'City of God', directed by Fernando Meirelles is not one of them. From the moment the film began until halfway through the closing credits, my eyes did not leave the television once. Based on a true story, 'City of God' spans two decades and is about rival street gangs in the town Cidade de Deus (City of God), just outside of Rio de Janeiro. The city is one where the government sends the 'unwanted' residents of Rio, so most of the inhabitants are homeless, criminal and/or dirt poor. The story is told through the eyes of Rocket, a young boy who manages to stay on the outer fringe of the gangs, befriending some of the hoods, but not participating. What he discovers he wants to do is become a photojournalist, and begins to take photographs of his neighborhood. When he is in his late teens/early twenties, he goes to work delivering newspapers, when one of his photographs of the slum gang boss is discovered and published without his permission, putting his life in danger, but beginning his professional career.There are so many reasons why 'City of God' is compelling, but besides its stylish and flashy cinematography and brutally realistic script, the pacing of the film is unrelenting. Not one time did I check the clock to see how far along we were in the film, even though I was on a time constraint. From start to finish, Meirelles gives us a solid yet exciting film. Of course, since I had no idea it was based on real events, 'City of God' became that much more intriguing, especially when, during the closing credits we see actual news footage of some of the primary characters, and we can see how closely the film mirrored actual events.With a film like 'City of God' it is nearly impossible to convey why it is an excellent film because it is just seamless and well done in so many ways.All I can do is recommend the film to pretty much anyone who is looking for a good story and a great presentation. See this film. Now. 9/10--Shelly"

            "Review": "One must step back from an absolute sense of repugnance at the violence and look at what the filmmaker has done in this movie. Once you tune yourself into the lives of this cast of characters and their ongoing effort to stay alive and maintain dominance, you can reflect on the amazing cinematography and overall effect of the film. There is an ebb and floe that we watch, almost a dance in the slums of Rio. There is so much poverty that factions have grown up and the people are continually victimized by them as are there individual members. The police are perpetually on the take, so a military state is eventually set up. The main character is a participant early on and then an observer. His photographic skills are his ticket out and his ticket in. There is death and destruction, drugs and murder around every corner. Perhaps the scariest thing are a group of young boys called the Runts who are making a seamless transition into the horrors of the place, keeping things going for yet another generation. I think the most dominant theme of the whole thing has to do with the indifference toward death. Even those who are friends early on will kill their friends because a drug lord says so. It's an unforgettable film."

            "Review": "The movie deals about children and adolescent factions in the impoverished Favelas , Rio Janeiro , for 1960 and 1970 years . And it centers upon a teen who tries to leave that world by means of the photography . The final confrontation among the motley gangs for Favelas control is pretty violent and bloody . In the motion picture there are shocks , emotion , sex , violence and a little bit of social criticism . Runtime film is overlong but it's fast moving and that's why it isn't boring but it results to be enjoyable . The picture is similar other film from 1981 : \u00a8Pixote\u00a8 (Hector Babenco) that was likeness in atmosphere and showing the delinquent vagrants . It's a thought-provoking and clever studio of juvenile paupers and unflinching remark at the underbelly of Rio Janeiro city , where teens and children become into burglars and assassins . The movie was not actually shot in Cidade De Deus slum as it was too dangerous ; it was shot in a neighbouring , less dangerous \u00e1rea . Principal actors' interpretation is outstanding , in spite of most are newcomers . All of the amateur actors were recruited from Favelas (slums) in Rio de Janeiro, and a couple of them actually lived in the Cidade de Deus (City of God) itself . Fernando Mereilles direction is awesome and stylish , he even has been hired by Hollywood to make lavish films . The motion picture had an Oscar nomination and obtained a lot of success at box office around the world . The movie is produced by Walter Salles , the best director and production manager from Brazil .The film is rated \u00a8R\u00a8 for crude murders and sex and isn't apt for boys , only for old people (+18) , neither squeamish. The flick will appeal to social drama and thoughtful films lovers . Rating: 7/10. Well worth watching."

            "Review": "City of God (2002)A broiling, gruesome, vivid, unforgiving submersion in the drug and crime world of a Rio de Janeiro barrio. You want to just say wow wow wow, it's so violent and awful, and yet the filming and acting, wow again, it's virtuosic and artful. On that most visceral level, there is no faulting a film with this kind of cinematic integrity.Questions start to rise by the last hour, however. In terms of the subject, you wonder, could it be so? Is life so apparently run by children with guns? Where are the older thugs, where are all the kids who aren't criminals, on and on? You come to realize this is a hugely partial view. That's okay, for sure--it's a movie--but it then draws attention to its own need for violence. You will never see so many people ruthlessly, heartlessly, even laughingly murdered, point blank, by children, on and on and on. This makes the movie awesome and awful, both. As a narrative story, it needs, it demands, greater complexity, and maybe, even if it's basically fiction, greater truth.On this level, the movie begins to depend on its energy to succeed. It has energy to spare, for sure, both in the acting, and in the camera-work, both of which are nothing short of unbelievable. But there is a lack, oddly enough with all these \"types\" of young men and boys, of actual \"character.\" Where is some sense of the psychology behind so many of these people. Yes, the mood, the interactions, the scenes taken whole, the groups and even the confrontations leading (usually) to murder, all are filled with human depth. But the individuals seem largely to be types of people, not digging into their motivations and their inner states of mine. Maybe that's asking too much.I've seen the movie twice now, and twice I got anxious half way through because it was mostly kinetics and film-making on crack. And it really is astonishing stuff. But as with Slumdog Millionaire, the fractured and imaginative mise-en-scenes would mean so much more with deeper understanding of the human elements involved.A masterpiece, with some large chinks in its armor."

Though some might complain of the shaky Super 16 footage, it is evidently for effect as the first half (golden age) is filmed with lots of aerials, and smooth, precise shots.Stunning in every sense"

            "Review": "\"I've made about 20 films and 5 of them are pretty good\"-Tom Hanks.\"Forrest Gump\" is one of the best movies of all time, guaranteed. I really just love this movie and it has such a special place in my heart. The performances are just so unforgettable and never get out of your head. The characters, I mean the actors turned into them and that's what got to me. The lines are so memorable, touching, and sometimes hilarious.We have Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks), not the sharpest tool in the box, his I.Q. is right below the average scores. But his mama(Sally Field) believes that her boy has the same opportunities as anyone else and lets Forrest know that there's nothing that could hold him back. As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn't have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school, NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice \"You can sit here if you want\". Jenny, Forrest's best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that's \"always kissing and touching her and her sisters\". Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest \"Run, Forrest! Run!\". He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny, a very tragic figure, she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her, in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, \"Forrest Gump\" is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.10/10"

            "Review": "Every once in a while, something comes along that hasn't been done before. This movie is one of those things. First of all, we have a principal character whose take on life is one where you don't judge it; you live it. I know he's a film character. It doesn't matter because we use images such as these to inspire us and to give us our own way of treating each day. Forrest lets no grass grow under his feet. He is the consummate optimist. He doesn't complain because he sees early on that it does you no good. His life is one adventure after another, in and out of the public eye, but his shyness and demeanor don't ever get to his head. He is the epitome of patience, something sadly lacking in the lives of most Americans. He is pushed around by the gusts of time and always lands on his feet. His relationship with a troubled girl is the one consistent thing in his life, and that is also shows his pugnaciousness. There are some commentators and reviewers who call this character stupid. He is a slow processor, but his stability lies in his morality and his consistency. His mother raised him well.Tom Hanks has become our new Jimmy Stewart. His roles are about human emotion and dedication. He is the everyman in many ways. Obviously, the subject matter has changed, but you can bank on his decision making when it comes to film. The other heroes are the special effects people. They are able to make this work; to create an incredible world for him to function within. The news clips are quite marvelous. I usually put this film in my top ten."

Bambi's mother, I couldn't care less. Jimmy Stewart in, \"Oh, what a wonderful life,\" - yeah right! The Lion King, when Mufasa bites the big one - on the verge.But seriously - I bawled my big brown eyes out, on several occasions in this film. A real tear-jerker, and a wonderful character, played to perfection by Tom Hanks. Every bit as worthy for the Oscar as Rooney was to win the Premiership in 2007.I cannot say it enough: This is THE film of all time. Watch it, and you'll see."

            "Review": "... seems to be the theme of this film. Forrest Gump has an IQ of 70, is being raised by a single mom, lives in a remote part of the Deep South where there are few opportunities, and has legs that require that he wear braces as a child. Sounds like the recipe for a sad tale or at least a slow death from mediocrity right? No, instead, because Forrest isn't really bright enough to realize the situation he is in, he simply does what he's told to do or what occurs to him to be the right thing at the time and succeeds due to a lack of self doubt. He's told to run and he becomes the star of the Crimson Tide and an All American. When recovering from a war wound, he's taught ping-pong and winds up competing at the global level in China itself. He promises his dying friend Bubba that he'll go ahead with their plans and become a shrimp boat captain and his brand of seafood products becomes a household name.All along the way he never learns the lessons in life that tend to make the rest of us cynical.Gump's childhood sweetheart Jenny starts out with high aspirations - she wants to be like Joan Baez and fight for world peace - and instead she winds up disillusioned, drug addicted, and a near suicide before age 30. She doesn't have Forrest's childlike innocence and this leads her to self-doubt and ultimately failure. Also, fate or \"destiny\" as the film calls it, is not on her side in one big way - her own father molested her as a child, which couldn't help but play a role in the decisions she made. Now Gump does have a bunch of coincidences on his side - call it destiny if you will - the storm that beaches every shrimping vessel in the Gulf of Mexico but his, for example - but in most cases this is just the story of a man going through life without self doubt and that little voice that tells the rest of us \"You can't do that! What are the odds! You'll fail! Make the safe choice!\" To me, this is what this film is about. I think everyone sees something different in it. I highly recommend it as it is truly one of a kind. I remember when it came out it absolutely made professional reviewers crazy that people liked this film, probably because they didn't understand it."

            "Review": "I remember John Byner, the stand-up comic and impressionist of the 1970s talking about guys crying at movies, how it's not an acceptable behavior. He advised the men in his audience to drop their keys, do something that gets them to lean forward, wipe their faces, and get things under control.I dropped my keys watching Forrest Gump. Lieutenant Dan comes over the hill at Forrest and Jenny's wedding, new legs, fianc\u00e9 at his side, clean-cut and happy.Forrest states the obvious, \"Lieutenant Dan, you gawt le-eggs!\"And the water-works just started to flow.I sit up straight and clear my throat. Got 'em (the keys, that is). My wife leans over and gives me a kiss. She says, \"That's why I love you.\"Other than a few historical fussinesses and plot slickeries, none of which are worth mentioning, this is as close to a perfect, emotionally-satisfying entertainment as I have ever seen. I love this movie. I never tire of the simple story of the guy with the lowest IQ in the room being the smartest guy in the room. It's filled with a patriotic decency you can only find in The Wizard of Oz and To Kill a Mockingbird.When Dorothy is aching for home and the Wizard can't deliver, I drop my keys. When Scout points to the man behind Jem's bedroom door and says, \"Hey, Boo,\" the fob goes flying.The next time I get out my copy to show to my 11th Grade US History kids, I'll start fingering my key chain. I can't help it."

            "Review": "A very eventful time in America's history, seen through the eyes of one man, Forest Gump, a man who has a very low IQ, a score of just 75.Tom Hanks, we all know just how good an actor he is, but there is something about his performances here that's extra special, he is simply outstanding. He's given many great performances over the years, this has always stood out.Forest sees Vietnam, the moon landings, presidential changes, and experiences a tough childhood and army life, all relayed from a public bench.It's funny, it's moving, it's wonderfully quirky. I have always loved the way they placed him into historical footage, that scene with John Lennon a personal favourite. It's a long film, but it's one that simply flies by.The music is fabulous throughout, some of the best, and most memorable songs of the time, you'll hear the likes of The Mamas and Papas, Scott McKenzie and many more, it's a terrific soundtrack.I saw it aged 14 when it was first released, and maybe didn't appreciate it at the time, now though, I think it's a captivating watch.Keep on running Forest.10/10."

            "Review": "I believe everyone has a right to their opinion about films or other topics. However from a lot of the comments I have read about this film, I do not think many got the gist of the message from the author and the film maker. This film is a great modern fable, a fable in the dictionary is defined as a brief fictitious story that teaches a moral. There are many morals defined in this film but foremost is integrity and a simple goodness.I have a half brother who grew up in the Southern U.S. and on one occasion we were discussing this film and he said he felt it portrayed Southerners as dimwitted. I disagreed with him and informed him that the author himself was a native Southerner. The setting is central to this story in that it lets the tale unfold tying in factual events with the fable before us.The film is wonderfully directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film is his opus and is acted by a great cast on all levels. From the children who were Forrest Gump and Gump Jr. by Haley Joel Osment. Say what you want but I feel Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar award. Gary Sinise is synonymous with Lt.Dan whenever you hear those words. Sally Fields is the loving dutiful mother in her challenging situation. Mykelti Williamson as Bubba gives you a real sense in the story that Gump had a genuine friend, he moves you with his character. Words don't grasp the full performance of Robin Wright Penn as Jenny. Jennys' tenderness and pain are palpable as exhibited by Wright.I feel that much of Gumps' appeal is his downright sense of doing the right thing regardless of the people and situations around him and we see that in this film. That being the case maybe we all wish we could be just a little more like that, trying to maintain innate goodness and not the trade-offs we often make as we go down lifes highways.The movie has it all too,drama,comedy and it challenges societal norms as well. Then there are the almost endless quotes from the movie that have slipped into everyday speech. They are too numerous to say at this point.One of the toppers for me in the movie is when Forrest is in a quandary about life and wondering as Lt.Dan said we all have a destiny and his Mom says it is where we are all just floating around like a feather in the wind. Forrest's character terms it very well with this quote,\"I think it is a little bit of both.\" From my experiences in life it does appear to be that way. So if you have not seen the movie,see it soon you are in for a real treat. If you did not like it, give it a try again and hopefully you will see it for the great story it is!"

As a Viet Nam veteran, and a college graduate of the late Sixties, I could of course personally relate to the various periods that Forrest Gump endures. I would only mention that the skillful and seamless blending of music, action, and period costume was enthralling. And yet it was so perfectly understated that Forrest Gump's travels through thirty five years of the stormiest and most meaningful years of American history only became clearly defined for the viewer. Even more so than the well known chocolates quote as a metaphor for life, I felt that the remark that stupid is what you do is probably more workable for most of us."

Brilliantly directed and inspiring comic drama about the truly extraordinary life and times of mentally challenged Forrest Gump (Hanks in the best role of his career won his second Best Actor Oscar in back-to-back winning roles), a simple, honest, and decent man whose childlike innocence is his lucky charm through his altering experiences that span the past two decades flawlessly. Mind-boggling Oscar-winning computerized effects by Industrial Light & Magic has Gump meeting the famous and infamous. Hanks is a wonder (dare you not to get a lump in your throat when it finally registers that he has a child {yes, that's Haley Joel Osment}- watch his face!) and gets fine support especially Wright as the love of his life and Sinise as his best friend (Best Supporting Actor nominee) superior adaptation of Winston Groom's novel by Eric Roth (also an Academy Award recepient) that truly captures lightning in a bottle. Oscars also went to director Robert Zemeckis and for Best Picture. *** One of my all-time favorite flicks. I still cry, particularly Forrest telling Jenny why he loves her so much (\"You're my girl!\") and at the gravesite when the birds fly overhead."

            "Review": "Starring: Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Sally Field This was flat out one of the best movies of 1994. It won best picture for a reason, along with a few other Academy Awards. I think one of the tag lines for the movie was, \"The world will never be the same once you've seen it through the eyes of Forrest Gump.\" How true. The movie is basically one simple man's journey through life. And what a journey.The movie opens with Forrest (Hanks) sitting at a bus stop, waiting to go see Jenny (Wright) after being apart from her for years. Who is Jenny, you ask? We'll get to that in a minute. Forrest strikes up a conversation or two with the people that come and wait for the bus with him. Or, more accurately, he keeps talking regardless of whether anybody is listening or not. The movie plays out as a flashback, with Forrest taking us through all the major events of his life and narrating them.The flashback starts when Forrest is a little boy, about six years old or so, just at about the age where he should be starting school. We get to take a look at Forrest's childhood as he gets leg braces to straighten out his back, as his momma (Field) fights (and does a few other things) to get him into public school, and as he meets for the first time the love of his life. Jenny. He meets her on the way to school, sitting next to her on the bus, and they strike up a friendship immediately.Eventually we progress to the point where Forrest and Jenny are in high school, and we travel along with Forrest as he makes it onto the football team and gets to go to college. Forrest and Jenny never date, but he's always there to protect her. Anytime he thinks she's in trouble, he rushes to the rescue, ready to beat the ever-loving snot out of anyone who even looks at his Jenny wrong. I think one of my favorite scenes in the movie is when someone is dumb enough to slap Jenny. The film goes slow motion, Forrest's eyes go wide, and he starts charging at this guy like a runaway locomotive, and has the striking force of one too. Watching him beat the crap out of that guy is hilarious.As Forrest grows up and goes through school, college, the army, a Vietnam tour, becomes a ping pong celebrity, a shrimp boat captain, and eventually one of the richest men out there, he also gets to take a few stops in history as the filmmaker gives us his own spin of how he thinks history would have happened if Forrest Gump were there. He gets to meet the President three times, he's the man who exposes the Watergate scandal, he's at the school doors when Governor George Wallace tries to get some Negroes into a white school, and so on and so forth. It's really funny the way they manipulate historical footage to insert Forrest into the events of the past.This is truly a great movie. You'd be a fool to miss it.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)"

The cinematography is stunning, the costumes are lovely and the scenery is gorgeous. The music is also very calm and relaxing, perhaps adding to the tone of this film. The screenplay is well crafted, and the story is simple. But what made this movie was its simplicity; it never tries to be too complex and is consequently moving. The acting is just as impressive; whilst Tom Hanks's accent is a little awkward in places, my only real criticism of this movie, he gives a truly remarkable performance, though I do think Morgan Freeman deserved the Oscar more for Shawshank. Robin Wright gives possibly the best performance of her career, and Sally Field is very dignified as Forrest's mother. The scene stealer though is Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan, a very moving and insightful performance. Overall, an extremely good movie, I will admit I wasn't sure whether I would like it, but the simple answer is this, I do. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

            "Review": "Take this with a grain of salt and don't be mad about certain things. Like one of the first flashbacks to the very beginning that does not come over preachy when it talks about the Klan (Ku Klux Klan that is, just in case you think I'm talking about any other Klan). Maybe sometime in the near future there will be a disclaimer and someone giving this context. But until then, you have to be educated enough yourself to understand and comprehend certain things. And you have to have a certain sense of humor to dig all the coincidences that Gump comes across at. It's alike a marathon through many landmarks of the short US history we have behind us. Like the Watergate scandal, Vietnam War, Black Panthers and so much more.If you can dig all that and go with the flow, than the chocolate box this opens up for you, will taste quite delicious. It had been quite a while since I saw this the first time, but it still worked its charme to say the least. Great movie, great actors - you have to be in the right mind set and mood though. And be able to forgive certain things ..."

The more you understand about this movie, the more you like it. And in terms of understanding it, my wife and I both were still gaining new understanding the 5th or 6th time we watched it. (For example: Why does Jenny behave exactly as she does throughout the movie? It'll take a lot of thinking to =fully= understand her.)Just the fact that we've seen it at least half a dozen times says a lot. There are few movies that I ever even give a second viewing. Like many of the truly good movies, there are people out there who see it once and consider it to be a waste of time. Such people are usually just looking for the most \"action,\" gore and sex they can find, and haven't a clue about films that actually involve thought, ideas, and life.Did I mention the script is absolutely brilliant? There are a lot of =truly= funny moments. And the music rocks. But those are only specific aspects of a movie that has just about everything else right about it as well.See it, enjoy it, think about it, see it again. Think about it some more. Forrest Gump is one of the greatest movies -- if not THE greatest -- ever made."

            "Review": "When Tom Hanks won his first Oscar for Philadelphia in 1993 the film received a total of five nominations. His second Oscar for Forrest Gump came in a film that received more than double that in nominations and awards. If Forrest Gump did nothing else it solidified Hanks's credentials as a serious actor. He would never be doing imitations of his Bosom Buddies character in films again.It also among other awards also won for Best Picture and Best director for Robert Zemeckis, richly deserved. The film is Huckleberry Finn like in its canny observations coming from the man who had an IQ we are told of 75. But as Forrest also tells us, \"stupid is as stupid does\". And Forrest with the hand of an unseen providence comes out a lot better than some of the clever people he meets in life.Watching the film once again it occurred to me that Mark Twain if he couldn't have written this himself would have loved the way Zemeckis handled the character of Forrest Gump. The beauty of Huckleberry Finn and the secret of its success is that Twain got into the mind of a child who recorded all the events around him, a child without too much education. What Zemeckis did was get Hanks into a child like mind who sees things with amazing clarity stripped of any veneer of pretense. Which Hanks observes in the people around him and in the events that shape America and himself from Eisenhower to Reagan.There are two prominent female parts in Forrest Gump. One is for Robin Wright who plays the abused child Julie as an adult. She is Forrest's love and best friend and she takes a different path of life one she chose with more deliberation than Hanks. Their fates though eventually entwined are radically different. The second major female role is for another two time Oscar winner Sally Field who now is playing matronly parts, a far cry from Gidget and the Flying Nun. She gives Forrest the maxims he lives by and in a crisis they turn out to be more than sound bite clich\u00e9s.Another award that Forrest Gump won is for Special Effects and an award it didn't win was for Gary Sinise in the role of Lieutenant Dan Taylor, Forrest's commanding officer in Vietnam. That's something that does not compute because the special effects were to show Gary Sinise as a double amputee with both legs lost in Vietnam.It's some amazing bit of work no doubt about it, but to honor it without Sinise whose performance really brings it off is ridiculous. Sinise is the educated one who curses the fate that happened to him, but in the end by just going with the flow he does prosper in the end. Sinise lost that year in Best Supporting Actor category to Martin Landau for Ed Wood, but I think Sinise's performance has had a more lasting impact.To those Americans who serve our country it certainly has. Gary Sinise has devoted a great deal of his life and earned treasure to bring entertainment to our overseas troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, wherever, becoming a successor to Bob Hope in that regard. He's gone further than that though, setting up foundations to help civilians in both countries and contributing to numerous charities dealing with war and its aftermath. Doing that in my humble opinion Gary Sinise has become one of the great Americans of our brand new millenia, a lot more than just an actor. He's forever now known as Lieutenant Dan.In the end though the film belongs to Tom Hanks who joined with Spencer Tracy as the only two male actors to win back to back Oscars for Best Actor. Hanks fascinates us and guides us through this film and when we're done we've seen something very special.If you don't believe me about how good Forrest Gump is, then watch it for a few minutes and see if you're not sucked in. Like Forrest's mama says, the film's like life which is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you'll get until you open it.\""

            "Review": "Based on the 1986 novel by Winston Groom of the same name; Forrest Gump is about a simple man, named Forrest (Tom Hanks) whom with a low I.Q. who goes through life, accidentally being present at many historic moments, while building success for himself, however, never getting with his true love, Jenny Curran (Robin Wright) which mostly seems to be the only thing, that is eluding him. Without spoiling the movie, too much, this feel-good, financial blockbuster was indeed one of my favorite movies from the 1990s. I still quote, act out, & rewatch this movie, even with the downer tragic ending, this film has. I just can't help, loving it, despite the film changing a lot from the source material, like Gump's core personality and size. I kinda like that, he's not an autistic savant. In my opinion, it would be, too jarring. It would be, really too odd and unrealistic to see him, play chess, while being an astronaut, while people still thinking that he's an idiot. I kinda like that the film primarily focuses on the first eleven chapters of the novel, before skipping ahead to the end of the book. The middle part of the book is truly outrageous with Gump fighting off, cannibals, and becoming a pro-wrestler. That was way too out there to be taken seriously! The careers, he got in the film, seems more grounded with the reality of his character and the story. In addition to skipping some parts of the novel, the film adds several aspects to Gump's life that do not occur in the novel, such as his needing leg braces as a child and his run across the United States. Those changes really did help the film, a lot. This movie was also well shot by Robert Zemeckis. It made great use of its locations. I also love the use of CGI techniques to make it look like Tom Hanks was in some of the archive footage with various historical figures. Most of the visual effects in this film were pretty impressing at the time. Yet, I just wish the voice-dubbing was a little better. It doesn't really match well, with the movement of the long-dead historical figure's lips! While, the movie does have a lot of profanity, sex/nudity, drug use and violence for a PG-13. I think it somewhat works with the rebellions style of the 1960s. I also dig the film soundtrack. Great use of many well-known artists of the 1950s & 1960s. It's really does fit with that era of time. Also, the original music that Alan Silvestri made for the film was also beautiful. It fits some well in the film. Not only did that work, but the acting was outstanding. Tom Hanks was amazing as the title character. In other hands, this dim-witted, guileless, Southern-drawling simpleton hero could had turn into a bumbling yet annoying unlikeable offensive mental retarded stereotype. Instead, Hanks makes the fictional character, Gump seem like a real person with real motives and feelings. He really did deserve the Oscar, despite what some critics make say about his performance. Even the supporting cast was well-done. I love all of the characters ranging from 'Bubba' Blue (Mykelti Williamson) to Mrs. Gump (Sally Fields). I even kinda like Jenny, even when the writers made her, somewhat a horrible selfish trouble-person, who leaves Gump with a kid that grew up to be Haley Joan Osment in one of his first movie roles. Then- who can ever forget, Lt. Dan Taylor? This was Gary Sinise finest role. The character development that they gave him, was heart-breaking, yet hopeful. I love his redemption story. The film has this 'ignorance is bliss' philosophy to it; that makes the movie, fun to watch. The satire on contemporary values, during America's mid-20th century accomplishments is truly funny. The historic 'zelig' style jokes are mostly a hit than a miss to the funny. I also like how ambiguous, Forrest's story, as some people believe that he might be an unreliable narrator who whitewashing American history. Yet, I don't think, it's as racist or sexist as some people think, it is. The film is a lot more positive than that. Forrest is a represented of what is innocence and good about the world. He has this, out right decency about himself. He helps his friends if they're in need, even if some of them, take advanced of his hospitality. Forrest Gump is also a surprisingly spiritual story, well-told. A lot of people has stated out, the relationship between Forrest and Jenny echoes the relationship of Hosea and Gomer in the Old Testament; which in return is about, the relationship between God and man. Hints, the white feather that floats through Forrest's life. The movie is about the question of whether we are masters of our own fate or on a path to a predetermined destiny. Another thing, interesting, is how some people has been noted to see some political interpretations which I kinda have to disagree with. While, it seem like Gump follows a very conservative lifestyle, Jenny's life is full of counter-cultural embrace, complete with drug usage, promiscuity, and antiwar rallies, and that their eventual marriage might be a kind of reconciliation between America's extremes political points; I agree with Hanks, the film was non-political and non-judgmental. Forrest Gump isn't about liberal or conservative values. It's about learning to live with your limitations, while also giving it, everything you got. About the film winning best picture in 1994 over films like 'The Shawshank Redemption' & 'Pulp Fiction', I think the movie deserve it. While, on the surface, those other two films look superior better and more mature. In true, 'Forrest Gump' has just as much to give as those films. Also, it's by far, the more entertaining film of the three. Overall: Forrest Gump is like a box of chocolates. It's super sweet."

            "Review": "What I find completely ridiculous is why this movie, in my opinion one of the best ever, has such a low rating, so I've tried to figure out what some found against it.I noticed that the haters of this movie who make it have a lower rating than it actually deserves mainly argue that it promotes the government's politics of submission: the idea that \"if you're an idiot but you do what you're told then you will be rewarded, but, if you experience life then you're going to die a miserable death.\" I'm not an American myself so i don't have any intention to defend the government or anyone else, but I think that the political events witnessed by the character in the movie make many miss the whole substance of the film. I think these bits of history only add to the magic of the film, making Forrest part of a fantastic world that seems so incredibly real though. How can somebody say that Forrest is just an idiot, an ordinary person who does everything that he is told to do? It appears to me that in fact,in his innocence, Forrest does what he feels he has to do,no matter the situations and the people around him, lead only by an inner sense of right. So what actually seems to be special about Forrest is that, regardless of his intelligence, he has the capacity to discover simple truth and life values that all the others around him miss: he tries to save Bubba endangering his own life, he gives Bubba's family money and mainly displays simple goodness in everything he does. So if you haven't yet seen the movie or you were disappointed by it, try watching it without analyzing things that much and just open your heart towards that world. The brilliant humour, the hilarious yet touching acting, the special effects and the uplifting message are totally rewarding."

            "Review": "This is a powerful yet charming movie; fun for its special effects and profound in how it keeps you thinking long after it's over. Like others, I've seen this movie more than once. One comment I've never heard is that Forrest's simplicity is almost zen-like. I should read the novel to get the author's intention (I remember some people preferring the book and complaining that no one at the Academy Awards gave him any credit.) But rather than an implication that you should do what you're supposed to do and believe in God and you'll win in the end, I see it as zen-like, i.e., living in the moment and not having expectations or particular cravings (other than his loving Jenny.) So he ends up just stumbling into all the major historical events of the time. Granted, he achieves this only because he doesn't have the brains to think otherwise and actually have expectations, but so many of our problems are because we do have higher intellect and desires, which ironically makes us unhappy because we know what we are missing. We love our cats and dogs for the same simplicity and always being in the moment. There's a line in the movie wondering if everything is predestined or happens randomly or it's a combination of both. It is something to mull over for a long time."

            "Review": "My 3rd time watching this movie! Yet, it still stunned my mind, kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterward.For someone like me, who've rarely slept without dream, it's so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen. As it's been done so sophisticatedly, I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception. In my opinion, it's been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writer-director career. I jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of Nolan's remarkable works:\nMemento, as his first signature in the cinema history, is tremendous and has stayed the most mind-bending film I've ever seen. But overall, it doesn't reach the same level of Inception.The Prestige is highly impressive but somehow I haven't been able to find the very particular \"Nolan's spirit\" in it.The Batman Trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak The Dark Knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well. Nonetheless, every time we talk about it, Heath Ledger takes all the spotlights with his life-time-role: The (unique-and-only) Joker.Then there came Inception where Nolan truly stood out, having every single detail of his work done in the finest way. The multi-layered storyline despite its complexity, remains consistent and originally interesting. From visual aspect, everything was masterly handled: an impeccable cross-cutting allowed the movie to follow Nolan's nonlinear story-telling without being scattered; a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visual-effects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes, some of them, I believe, will stay in the audience's mind for a long time (city bending in Paris, zero-gravity fight, in limbo, dreams collapsing...). In addition, Nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messages.Later, we had Interstellar. Though I did admire its cinematography and visual-effects, the film itself is nowhere near the level of Inception.\nSPOILERS AHEAD !!!!! For all who haven't watched this movie, you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilers!It is set in the world where there's technology that allows people to literally share dream. There is, in this world, a new kind of corporate spy - \"extractors\" who use this technology to infiltrate the target's subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world. Our hero Mr Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a very well-known extractor, and his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are approached by a powerful businessman - Mr Saito (Ken Watanabe) for a nearly impossible mission, something no one has ever done before : instead of stealing, he wants them to plant an idea in a person's subconscious, which is also called \"inception\". In return, Saito offers something that Cobb could never resist: a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him. So Cobb and Arthur gather a team to carry out the mission: Eames (Tom Hardy) - a veteran identity forger, Yusuf - the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3-levels \"dream within a dream\", and Ariadne (Ellen Page) - a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission. The target is Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) - son and heir of Saito's biggest competitor (Maurice Fischer, who's dying). The goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his father's business, and the team has to carry Saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception. While the team go deeper and deeper into Fischer's mind, we discover gradually the dark of Cobb's past, as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero: Why he has became such an expert of inception and What is his desperate motivation for taking that insane mission.The movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly, about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life. In Cobb's case, it's the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) and his regrets. So as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife, it will keep coming back and haunt his present: the deeper the team go into dream, the more dangerous his subconscious, under the form of his ghostly wife, comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission. Indeed, if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story, the ending scene makes perfect sense. Yes! We're now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history. Did Cobb find Mr Saito in limbo, bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world? Or they are still stuck in limbo - the infinite dream world, and the last scene was just his big dream? But all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story: the result of inception mission. When we perceive the story in its deeper layer, as a journey for Cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and re-find the meaning of his life, this ending did fulfill its job. Cobb didn't even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didn't care any more, what's important to him is that he gonna be with his kids. He did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on, and that matters. And after all, dream or reality, the importance is to truly live. So from this point of view, he has solved the maze of his life.\nSome short lines about the cast:\nLeo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in Shutter Island and Blood Diamond.Joseph Gordon-Levitt could have been more intense, given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie (zero-gravity sequence).There was something missing in Ken Watanabe's performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission. Maybe it was his English...Tom Hardy was OK but forgettable because his character didn't have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen time.Ellen Page was really impressive, she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect. And personally, I did find a lot of charms in her acting.Cillian Murphy has also done a great job. Much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission, his character Robert Fischer, at the end, was not so different than our hero Cobb. They both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze. If for Cobb, it was the painful past with his late wife; for Fischer, it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dad.Last but not least, the one who impressed me the most was Marion. Mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way, mostly with her speaking eyes! And for me, she is the most remarkable character of the movie."

I'm not gonna mention details, because can't share any spoilers.Simply this movie makes a complex story, that makes you question so many things. \"Why he is keeping her in his dreams?\" or whatever your question is answering with some well written line. That scene is the key to the whole movie. That line between Cobb and Mal answers all your questions at once.That's why I like this movie so much. Some movies has that potential. Making a complex story that someone could answer with only one sentence. You're waiting for that line for whole content. But most of the contents (I mean movie or TV Series) are not managing that well.Besides the greatness of the storyline this movie has a really great cast. So Acting Performances are also great. Award Winning Cinematography by Wally Pfister was too great. Original Scores by Hans Zimmer was brilliant. Visual Effects are unique. So not only the Screenplay but nearly all the technical details are great."

Truly in awe at how amazing this movie is, an astounding show of all aspects of films. Amazing story and cinematography accompanied with actors worthy of telling the tale.

            "Review": "What is the most resilient parasite? An Idea! Yes, Nolan has created something with his unbelievably, incredibly and god- gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away. The world premiere of the movie, directed by Hollywood's most inventive dreamers, was shown in London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this?Dom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he's increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions. Cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he had lost his love!But then, as fate had decided, a wealthy business man Saito( Ken Watanabe) hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his business rival Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). But this time his job was not to steal the idea but to plant a new one: 'Inception'Then what happens is the classic heist movie tradition. To carry out the the task, Cobb's 'brainiac' specialists team up again with him, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy (Eames), a \"forger\" who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a powerful sedative supplier.There is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You don't just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is electronically haunting. Never, in the runtime of the movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.Leonardo, who is still popularly known for Jack Dawson played by him in Titanic, should be relieved as his role as Dom Cobb will be remembered forever. His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will be his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan, ah! What a man he is. His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the 'Best Director' category. If \"Inception\" is a metaphysical puzzle, it's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.To conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan!My Rating: 10/10Thanks & Regards."

Inception is Sooooooooo dang exciting, edge of seat, mind blower, and I wish there were more movies like it and more Christopher Nolans out there. Congratulations to the well deserved best director, writer, and producer of films (in my opinion). Also the acting is fabulous, everyone did an amazing job, and Leonardo was fabulous at explaining the dream concept. Also the CGI and effects are amazing. Go watch Inception because it is incredibly amazing in every aspect, and is my number one film of my twelve years on earth. Bravo to the Inception crew and wow at this fabulous movie!"

            "Review": "Films about dreams and the subconscious are usually not very straightforward and almost always weird. \"Inception\" is no exception to that rule, but like its cinematic predecessors who have explored the contrast between and the questions of what is real and what is illusion (i.e. \"The Matrix\" (1999), \"The Cell\" (2000), \"Abre Los Ojos\" (1997) & its American remake \"Vanilla Sky\" (2001)), you really can't look away, nor should you.\"Inception\" is an excellent and breathtaking movie that may be one of the only films released so far during the Summer of 2010 that lives up to its hype. It is a nearly perfect and highly original film that holds your attention until the credits roll. The less you know about this movie going in, the more you will be entranced by seeing it.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, a world class criminal who, with the help of a team of sleep experts, works his way into people's subconscious and steals what people value most: ideas directly from their minds. In his last assignment to possibly clear his name, he is assigned not to steal an idea from someone, but to plant one inside that person's mind. The difficulty comes when certain people are trained to block their ideas from being taken.That plot summary only covers the basics of this pretty complicated story, but to describe every plot detail would take away the magic of this film you must see yourself to believe. DiCaprio is good in his role, but unlike many other films he has starred in, this is perhaps his only role where his character alone does not carry the weight of the movie on his shoulders or share it equally with one other co-star. Instead, this great ensemble cast teams together to make this movie work, just as their characters collaborate to pull off such a unique heist. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy are especially good in their roles.The special effects in this film were also very good, which is amazing considering their simplicity compared to the \"Matrix\" movies. There are slow-motion shots, but no impossible kung fu fighting sequences. It's especially interesting when the film gets into the architecture of certain dreams, and impossible sequences are filmed in a way I've never seen other than in drawings.However, the special effects would mean nothing if the story wasn't good. For this reason, even something as simple as a spinning top holds your attention in a way you would never think it would when seeing it in this film. The credit here can be given to writer and director Christopher Nolan, who has not made a bad film yet. There are many twists and turns in this film, but Nolan never loses his focus in the process of telling the story. If Nolan does not get nominated for Best Director and/or Best Original Screenplay next Oscar season, there is something terribly wrong with the Academy.That being said, there was still a lot about this film I still don't get, and may require multiple viewings to better understand. However, some of the best films I've seen are confusing at first. \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (1968) is a film I've seen a couple of times, and still don't understand completely. It still has a major following, though, as I'm positive this movie will. It's an incredibly entertaining movie, but it also makes you think and continues to do so after you leave the theater."

            "Review": "This review is being written by a 46 year-old guy. I mention this because clearly this is a film where age is important, as younger folks probably will enjoy the movie more--and can take the fast-paced action and frenetic pace. I assume older audiences probably will be a little less amazed and a bit overwhelmed with the film. Just something to consider as you read this.As for the movie, I'll be up front about the fact that I did NOT love this film. It's just not the sort of movie I'd usually see and only went because my oldest daughter nagged me to go. I am glad I did, however, as I really could respect the movie in many ways. First, the story is wildly original (though, also quite confusing). Other than the Matrix films, I can't think of anything that even comes close to it in style. Second, the production looked and sounded great. The music was intense and worked great with the amazing, totally amazing, special effects. Third, it was nice to see so many kid actors show that they are NOT light-weights and could act. Leonardo DiCaprio is no longer the pretty young thing he was in \"Titanic\"--his maturity and grit were welcome. Also, seeing the kid from \"Third Rock\" suddenly playing an action hero was great--you'd barely recognize him--or the other grown child actors. Fourth, I loved the ending--it really pulled everything together very well.So why am I not giving the film a glowing review? Well, I am simply not an action film fan. And, the insane pace, TONS of shooting and crazy plot simply lost me at times. I much preferred the slower and more introspective moments of the film. Also, while Ken Watanabe is a fine actor, I had a devil of a time understanding a lot of what he said--to the point where I wish they'd either dubbed him or had caption! Now this is NOT just because I am an old crank who is slightly hard of hearing--my daughter, too, found his thick accent difficult. On the other hand, Ms. Cotillard was VERY easy to understand and I was surprised how well she controlled her lovely French accent.I could probably go on and on about the film--as it's long, complex and VERY prone to be one to watch and re-watch and discuss with friends. However, at this point, there are already a bazillion reviews and 7 billion people have already gone to see it, so I'll call it a day.Well worth seeing....but perhaps too frenetic and confusing for many."

            "Review": "I'm nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn't follow up to \"The Dark Knight\", he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can't help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.Not since the eras of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan. He is, undoubtedly, one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes, ears and most importantly, mind, and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes, it is similar to the excellent anime film \"Paprika\" in the whole \"invading dreams\" plot, but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level.Visuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time, it's either all-visuals-no-smarts (\"G.I. Joe\", \"Transformers\") or the exact opposite (\"Doubt\", \"Invictus\"). In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jaw-dropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability.Although having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio (Warner Bros), this film is a very personal film for Nolan, he wrote the film as well as directing it, and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolan's perplexing, increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up. Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film. This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher, rather it is a film for thinkers. Honestly I can't explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers. Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience. The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed, confused and ultimately breathless. It's like a puzzle, both physically and mentally, and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues. However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the film's humanity, and this is where \"Inception\" shines. It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come. That's right, years.Once the film ends, you'll want to watch it again, for there's something new every time. This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the film's ambiguous themes, and will be discussed by many in the future. This is an original film, no adaptation, no sequel/prequel, no remake/reboot, which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows (\"Avatar\" be damned).Of course, a film is not complete without the actors. Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance, similar but better than his previous effort \"Shutter Island\". He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can't seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own.Nolan is of course, a master behind the camera, a real virtuoso when it comes to film. His direction is taut, focused, gripping, and extraordinarily fascinating. The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan, considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into pop-culture art two years ago (\"The Dark Knight\"). The action sequences are unique, exciting and fresh, something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds. The visual effects are awesome and imaginative, and best of all they do not bring down the movie's quality one bit, rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch. The cinematography is absolutely, beautifully shot, so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory. Production design is top notch, with terrific design of sets and locations. Hans Zimmer's complementing music score is simply outstanding, and knowing the man, that's really all I have to say. Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this year.Christopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He truly is a gifted filmmaker, arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today. And \"Inception\" can proudly stand alongside \"Blade Runner\" and \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" as science-fiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogether.There are two types of films: the crowd-pleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that rare, now nearly-extinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people.Missing this film and not getting the film's point is a crime.Overall value: 9/10 (Excellent)"

I feel like it's kind of pointless to compare this to Blade Runner, Aliens, Terminator 2, 2001: A Space Odyssey or any other sci-fi blockbusters, for they're completely different. What Nolan crafted is genius, in my mind he is still yet to make a bad movie, it is now time to get into spoiler territory.Inception is a story about dreams, how you can build anything you want, Nolan took 10 years to write the screenplay and it was definitely worth-while, this is one of the most mind-blowing, nail-biting, epic action packed science fiction movies of all time. All the performances in this film are amazing, the special effects are flawless, the acting is flawless, the story is flawless, the writing is flawless, this is one of a few pictures that just got everything right in all categories, most people saw there is no such thing as a flawless movie and I would 100% love to disagree with them there, all of the Christopher Nolan movies I have seen so far have no real flaws. Leonardo DiCaprio+Christopher Nolan= pure gold, these two should definitely collaborate more, Inception just proves that Chris is a cinematic God, from his screenplays, to his production, to his film direction, everything is perfect!You have to imagine it to believe it. Watching it once isn't enough, watching it twice isn't enough, you have got to watch this 10 times or even more to really get the true essence of why this movie is considered to be one of the greatest of all time. It is truly film-making at it's greatest! It is one of the most re-watch-able movies a director has ever put out! It's like Dark Knight, Memento and most of his other work where immediately after you watch it you feel like watching it again.At times it gets confusing because sometimes it feels like it's the real world when it is actually the dream world and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance, oh my god! In my opinion it is his greatest performance. And Inception SHOULD HAVE WON BEST PICTURE! Fun fact: This film got nominated for Best Screenplay and many other Oscar nominations, yet they don't nominate the man who put it all together who DIRECTED THE GOSH-DARN MASTERPIECE!I watch this film at least twice a week and to see that Watchmojo put Social Network higher than Inception on their Top 10 Movies of the Decade list p*sses me off! Yeah, it's David Fincher, I get that Watchmojo love David Fincher, but higher than Inception? NAH!If anybody else directed this it would be an average, unoriginal and completely unimaginative piece of work. When Nolan gets his hands on something it is always going to be original, classic and everything great about movies. I'd place this on my top 5 films of the century list, most films on that list would include Nolan films because he is the best director working today and you have to accept that.More will be added soon..."

            "Review": "Inception is written, produced, and directed by Christopher Nolan. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Dileep Rao, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine. The musical score is by Hans Zimmer and Wally Pfister is the cinematographer. Plot finds DiCaprio playing Dom Cobb, a specialised spy for hire who steals ideas from the dreams of people. But one day he gets a different offer, one that will enable him to see his estranged children. To get his reward he must enact Inception, the planting of an idea in the mind of the selected target. But Inception is thought impossible and should Cobb and his selected team fail? The consequences are unthinkable.There has already been much written and pondered about as regards Inception in the relatively short running time of its life. One can only imagine what will be written and said about it in ten years time. For although it's arguably a bit too early to be talking about it being held in such high regards as the likes of 2001: A Space Odyssey, it's inescapable that Nolan's movie is this current generation's sci-fi classic. That Nolan has managed to make it accessible to the mainstream, and dazzled the eyes as much as the brain in the process, is close to being a piece of genius craftsmanship.Inception is a film that it's better to know nothing about before venturing into it, and then it asks, well Nolan asks, for your undivided attention. It's neither as confusing as some have painted it, nor does it have any tricks-peek behind the curtain type-up its sleeve. The truth is is that Inception has something for everyone; thematically speaking, and that's before we pore over the special effects that sees Nolan raising the bar considerably. As is the case with twisty high concept movies, interpretations are many, with the director rightly abstaining from discourse about his movie. What forms the basis is your basic life and death struggles, with the grey areas during and after given a clever cinematic make over. There's also meditations on grief that this reviewer personally found easy to get involved with; that of course wont work for everyone, but that is just one of many strands that Nolan dangles for the discerning viewer.If that all sounds a bit too serious for the man who has redefined the Super Hero genre, rest assured thrill seekers, Inception is also a loud swirly spectacle. The action is raucous, be it gun fights or zero gravity punch ups, Nolan has not lost the ability to take the viewer on an action fuelled roller-coaster ride, aided superbly by Lee Smith's editing and Pfister's perfectly broad photography While Zimmer's score blends electronic action pulse beats with saddened guitar strains (ex-Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr on 12 string) to craft one of the best scores of 2010. As I said, there's something for everyone here, making it perhaps one of the leading nominees for title of ultimate modern day blockbuster.Then there's the strong ensemble cast, led by a quite scintillating performance from DiCaprio. Following on from his cards played close to his chest turn in Shutter Island, DiCaprio has given 2010 two of its best lead performances. Here he gives real depth of emotion, the kind that makes it easy for the viewers to hang their hats on. His unfussy acting is easy to buy into, giving the character the air of believability, he is the glue that binds the whole film together. Murphy is wonderfully vulnerable, very much an axis in the narrative, while Levitt almost usurps DiCaprio with a neatly layered portrayal that carries a delightful whiff of duality about it. Special praise, too, for Ellen Page. Still in her early 20s, she exudes an intelligent sexiness that shines bright in a role that could have been boorishly played as a cipher in a lesser actress' hands. While Hardy provides brawny levity and Berenger leaves a favourable mark.The Matrix meets Heat and Mission Impossible, only it's written by Phillip K. Dick and Richard Matheson; or something like that. A cracking hybrid movie that's fit to grace any summer and sure to improve and enlighten with further viewings. 9.5/10"

            "Review": "I'd like to keep my review rather to the point.Pros: 1. its theme - dream is a fascinating topic to say the least. There are a lot of unknowns in dreamworld. 2. its plot - there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns. 3. its edgy drive - although you know what's coming next, still you feel jumpy about it when it does.4. its rapid storyline - the story moves fast from one scene to another, making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride. At times, it's hard to keep up, even after watching it several times. 5. its sophistication - there is a lot of information to remember and digest. This is the very thing the modern moviegoers are after, I believe. 6. its realism - okay, pun intended. The movie explains (or at least tries to) the ins and outs of what dream is about and how it functions, some of which are very familiar with and dear to us.Cons: 1. its poor character development - although the acting was convincing enough there was not enough of character development. I wonder how many people really felt connected to the main character(s) after watching the movie. Yes, the movie talks about emotional struggles but it was more of an action film than anything else, if you ask me. 2. too many distractions - I found that the movie had more characters than necessary. They may play certain roles in the plot but they seemed more of distractions than anything else. I wish the movie was more focused. 3. a bit preachy - I noticed that the characters would explain things about dreamworld and then the exact things happen later in the movie. I'm afraid, Inception overused this trick. In conclusion, its theme is fascinating but its delivery is not without room for improvement. I highly recommend you to go and read Somewhere carnal over 40 winks, if you dig this kind of flicks. Cheers!"

            "Review": "I saw Memento very recently, something that turned out to be a great miss.I saw it again, just to make a couple of thins straight-and i'll definitely do the same with Inception.Christopher Nolan keeps improving himself, with even more complex and multilayer script like this.And i thought Memento was hard to reach by most of the viewers, but no.Inception will keep you mesmerized and captivated by the genius, that's hidden behind it.And not just directors and screenwriters (or with other words-Nolan), but with acting and sound-and effects and editing as well.When you have a cast like this-i mean Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Michael Caine, or Marion Cotillard (a personal favourite), the movie just keeps going flawlessly.Most of the crew is the same the Nolan brothers worked with on TDK and earlier in Batman Begins.So the Oscar noms in those categories are a certainty for me.The only thing one could have against the movie, is the headache one could have.See, most of my friends go to the movies for brainless action, they enjoyed Iron Man 2 and The A-Team, but this movie-you have to see it at least twice, to understand it.The levels and the layers on which thing are happening are so many, that one surely'll miss something vital.This is a reason for not fitting to the mass audience, but i hope that won't happen, because Nolan is one of my favourite directors/writers, and he showed, that the brainless action flicks aren't all of it.There are still movies like Inception out there and still people like the Nolans to make those movies, so it's not all lost.And i hope this movie could show the audience that the story is still important for the experience one could receive, not the endless, constant explosions.Because this is really a one of a lifetime event.Saying that, i must say, that in a world full of remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels and God knows what, this is a unique chance to see something different and unmatched so far-a strong movie, that, surely will be Nolan's latest masterpiece! My Grade won't change-it's the same for all Nolan movies-sheer 10!"

            "Review": "Inception is truly one of a kind. A concept which has long gestated in Christopher Nolan's mind, his eye for drama mixed with his large scale sensibilities ring true in Blockbuster season making Inception a true original in the sea of reboots, remakes and sequels.To try and explain Inceptions many plot twists and incredibly intelligent arcs, would be a foolish task. As Nolan himself has been reluctant to. The best way to approach the film would be with an open mind, if you are prepared to be taken on a ride of a lifetime, then trust that you 100% will. If Avatar was a seminal film in technology (although coming out as a rather poor film, in my opinion), then Inception is seminal in it's storytelling. With a 148 minute running time, you would expect a lot to take place, but what you wouldn't expect is the pace of it all. I did not think at one time in the film about how long was left. I was simply blown away by the depth in every single part of the film. If my enthusiasm for the storytelling aspect of the film has left you worried about the spectacle, then don't worry. They are, as hinted in the trailer, incredible, looking real and unbelievable simultaneously. The most pleasing thing about the action set pieces, is that they are genuinely used to illustrate the story, rather than to blow stuff up a la Michael Bay.With this complex movie in it's high concept, a stellar cast is needed. And Nolan as always, delivers with just that. This is vintage DiCaprio, perhaps only equalled in The Aviator, which is even more impressive as his role as Cobb in Inception is not a showy one, needing DiCaprio to be the constant at the centre of the film. And he pulls off Cobb's emotional contradictions sublimely. The rest of the cast members all shine in parts of the films, Cillian Murphy shows off his usually non-existent tender side, Gordon-Levitt bottles his usual charm for his confidently reserved turn as the reliable Arthur, Watanabe is devilish as the seemingly ambiguous Saito, Page shows why she's the next big female star and Tom Hardy revels in being the comic relief of the film compared to his recent turns as decidedly psychopathic characters.Overall, Nolan has indeed surpassed himself. He has created a world as expansive as his Gotham, a plot dwarfing the intricacies of Memento and one which blows The Prestige's cinematic reveal out of the water. This is truly unmissable cinema. Revel in it, we've still got to wait a whole two years before Batman 3."

            "Review": "What do we ask for in a summer blockbuster? What is it that incites hysteria this time every year for whatever dross the studios churn out? Epic hugeness? Blowing stuff up? Romance? Action? Heroes? What are we looking for in a blockbuster? I think it all boils down to thrills! Audiences want the thrill of a car chase, the thrill of romance, the thrill of the spectacular! If that is the case, then Inception just might be the greatest summer blockbuster of all time as it also contains something we often don't look for...brains! \"What is the most resilient parasite? An idea\" says Leonardo Di Caprio's character Cobb. Well, Inception is all about ideas. It's all right there in the title. The film central idea revolves around \"Extractors\", who are paid to extract secrets from people's subconscious minds by sneaking into their dreams, usually for the purpose of corporate espionage. However, when one client asks them to plant an idea in the mind of their corporate rival, \"Inception\" is born. The less said about this film the better. It is full of ideas and invention and for each set piece I divulge, a piece of the film's genius is weakened. This is a film that cleverly and intricately brings the audience through several planes of existence simultaneously but never allows the viewer to feel lost. Such is the power of Christopher Nolan's script which, I imagine, is likely to get overlooked due to the sheer visual magnificence of his direction. But everything that makes this film so great is in the script...in the ideas! Everything else is just spectacle. This film bears an uncanny resemblance, thematically, with DiCaprio's other instant classic this year, Shutter Island. Both films investigate in depth the tricks a traumatised mind can play on the individual. Both films are luscious to watch and both films keep the audience firmly outside the realm of reality. However, Inception is an even more layered film than Shutter Island and I believe the sci-fi genre setting will prove to be less alienating for audiences than the prison noir of Scorsese's film. There is not a single dull moment in Nolan's film. There is style, charm and intelligence in every frame of the film. Every performance is pitch-perfect with some strong support by Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt particularly who have grown up right before our eyes into undeniable movie stars. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a typically flawless performance as the muddled, grieving man who we never quite trust to be living in the real world. The best part of Inception is the large amount of effects which were done in camera. While the film does make use of CGI, there are some pretty mind-blowing practical effects which are as simple as the camera telling beautiful lies; a rare treat these days. This is a blockbuster that ticks all the boxes; smart, sexy (femme fatale, sexy brainy girl, very beautiful men in very beautiful suits) and magical. Inception is the kind of film that reminds me why cinema will never die. Because anyone who thinks it's OK to watch this film on a laptop or iPad is a fool! This is pure cinema, and proud of it. Not to be missed on the big screen!"

This film is certainly a tour de force. It requires engagement at every step. LIke most works of art, it doesn't give it all away. I look forward to seeing this the second or even third time. First of all, the premise is wonderfully engaging. Our consciousness is layered as everyone knows who thinks they have awakened, only to find themselves in another nightmare--then they awaken again. We know that the subconscious by nature is out of our control. There you have a wonderful premise. Now layer that further with people who can flip in and out and use this to their own ends. While confusing, it's exciting. The amazing thing is that the director/writer pulls it off. Every nuance and event is picked precisely for its effectiveness. We have the luxury of watching from one precipice into the abyss. We do care about the people and not just because we want them to succeed. We care about the matrix of the dream levels. Great movie."

            "Review": "Surrealism can appear to be ineffably bizarre, or inquisitively titillating, depending purely on the viewer's intellect. Though the realm of surrealism is highly nebulous and complex, but even a slight attempt at improvisation can sometimes go awry and open a Pandora's Box, making the task highly improbable and nigh impossible. This facet of reality may pose a handicap to the most gifted of the directors, but not to the genius of Christopher Nolan, who not only dabbles with the concept of surrealism, but also ingeniously blends it with the elements of Science Fiction in his latest wonder named Inception. Nolan created a niche for himself a decade back by unleashing a monster of a movie called Memento. He further substantiated his status by conjuring movies like Insomnia, The Prestige, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. His unremitting desire for innovation and uncanny craving to foray into the unexplored realms of imagination deservedly earned him an auteur tag, which gave him the carte blanche that a story-teller like Nolan desperately needs. It's highly apparent that Nolan takes every possible advantage of this liberty while filming Inception. Inception is not only dreamlike, but is a dream in itself and is superior to any other thing conceived on the silver screen. With its entwined layers, the movie for the most part serves as an unfathomable riddle and makes multiple viewing extremely essential. It incredibly does extremely well on both the humanistic as well as the technical fronts. In fact, the balance between human emotions and the elements of Science Fiction is so adequate that it's impossible to separate them. The movie is about a futuristic world where the human mind can be intercepted through dream invasion. Cobb is an expert in the art of extracting information (stealing valuable secrets) from deep within the subconscious in the dream state. His proficiency in extraction is marred by a turmoil that begins with his wife's untimely death. He is forced to live the life of a fugitive away from his children. His only chance for redemption lies with a Japanese tycoon named Saitu, who wants him to do an inception (planting information into someone's mind). In order to accomplish this unprecedented task, Cobb and his team must overcome a labyrinth of unforeseeable challenges, where even a slight miss could trap them in a perpetual limbo. Any further revelation would be remissness on my part as the plot is filled with such intricacies that even expatiation would be incapable of justifying its profundity. Leonardo Dicaprio gives a solid performance in the lead role, following his memorable performance in Shutter Island. He has brilliantly depicted the complexities and limitations of Cobb's enigmatic character highlighting his pain and mental trauma. Marion Cotillard is ravishingly scintillating as Cobb's whimsical wife, Mal. The rest of the cast has given a thorough performance with special mention of Ken Watanabe, Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.Inception is incredibly brilliant as a movie and is a breakthrough in contemporary cinema. Nolan's creativity and his unparalleled execution definitely make it an object of great cachet, but whether it would become Bu\u00f1uel's 'Un chien andalou' or Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' and serve as a prototype for the movies to come is for the time to decide. Irrespectively, Inception is sine qua non not only for an aficionado, but also for the average viewer, who is willing to delve deep enough to savour the delight.PS: One has to imagine it to believe it. 9/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"

I feel sorry for people who refuse to watch a movie like Life Is Beautiful just because it is a foreign film. They have no idea what a beautifully acted and directed film this is, and they'll never know what an amazing experience they are missing. Life Is Beautiful manages to walk the extremely thin line between humor, fantasy, and tragedy. Sure, the film is clearly comedic, but nevertheless it manages to very effectively communicate the tremendous losses suffered in the Nazi concentration camps and has scenes at least as intense as any scene in Schindler's List. This is one of the best films that I have ever seen. It manages to be so encompassing that you hardly notice the subtitles are even there. I proudly cast my vote of 10."

            "Review": "Before I watched this film, I was a bit hesitant because the basic premise sounds so ridiculous--a man who uses humor and imagination to shield his son from the horrors of the holocaust while in a concentration camp! I mean, how can this movie be funny? Is this another \"Hogan's Heroes\" or what, I thought.Well, first, most of the humor in the film occurs BEFORE the internment. This makes sense and allows the movie to be in good taste. I found myself laughing out loud on many occasions with the silly buffoonery of Benigni as he tries to capture the heart of a woman he keeps \"bumping into\". These moments also abound with charm and seem rather reminiscent of the work of Chaplin--lots of physical humor and charm.The second half of the movie does indeed take place in a prison camp. Occasionally, there were some mildly humorous moments but the goal was not a cheap laugh but were desperate attempts to convince the child that he should not give up hope. Despite the ludicrousness of the plot at this point (hiding a little boy in a men's dormitory in a prison camp), the way they explain it works out perfectly and should not offend or diminish from the horrors that were the holocaust.This film, though VERY cleverly written, was carried by Benigni's marvelous acting. He rightly deserved the Oscar for Best Actor for all his charm, enthusiasm and magnetism."

            "Review": "Mixing humor and the Holocaust isn't anything new: Ernst Lubitsch's 'To Be Or Not To Be' is just one enduring classic; Mel Brooks' 'The Producers' is another; and 'Life Is Beautiful' has the small-town charm and ambiance of 'Amarcord,' and light-straight satire of 'The Great Dictator.'Set against the stark reality of World War II Europe, Roberto Benigni's sentimental fable is not a film about the Holocaust, it's a film about life and hope merely against the backdrop of the Holocaust... It's not a denial of the Holocaust, it is a manifestation that humor itself can be courage... It's not about betraying the experience of millions of Jews, it is about the great lengths a father will go to protect his family from the horrors of the Nazis... It's a demonstration of the power of cinema, it's art without claim, hope without fear, dreams without limitations... It's a motion picture about love, not a documentary about the Nazis... It delivers a powerful message that despite everything\u0097life is truly beautiful... The story begins in 1939 Italy, where a simple, free-spirited Italian Jew Guido Orefice (Benigni) and his poet friend Ferrucio (Sergio Bini Bustic) have dreams of owning their own bookstore... For now, however, Guido must be satisfied to wait tables, while Ferrucio is unable to get a job...Benigni's character is introduced during a long set of fast comedy scenes, particularly when he meets a cute gentile woman, Dora\u0097Nicoletta Braschi, Benigni's real-life wife... When she 'falls out of the sky,' and he quickly nicknames her 'Principessa'... When he rides, in a fascist ball, on a horse painted green... When he turns a gloomy rainy night into a red carpet event... When he is caught by the Nazis as he hurries about securing the safety of his wife and son.. When his car speeds, without brakes, through a village and is mistaken for a king... Guido falls hard for the radiant schoolteacher, daughter of a wealthy family, and pursues her with all the charm and imagination he can discharge... In one sequence he pretends to be a school inspector and gives an impromptu speech on racial superiority before the assembled students and teachers, ending with a striptease...That hilarious side of the film takes up the first half... Benigni (who also wrote and directed) borrows a bit of Chaplin's grace and a bit of Groucho Marx charm... All of the action is so neatly contrived that the film essentially ends when it's over, and then begins again with the introduction of Guido and Dora's cute five-year-old son Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini) few years later... There, in 1945, we catch a glimpse of their enchanting household, but things are soon shattered, and the Nazis take Guido, with his tolerant uncle (Giustino Durano) and little Giosue off to an unidentified concentration camp... Dora races to the train station and demands to be put also on the train... At the death camp, and in order to protect his son from the nightmare of the place, Guido uses his imagination by creating the illusion that everything that's happening is just a game, an epic game that will be exciting and fun...He convinces Giosue that by hiding from the Gestapo soldiers (whom he refers to simply as the \"men who yell a lot\") and maintaining silence, he can gain the necessary points to win a tank... Not a toy tank, but a full-size tank, which they'll be free to take home...As co-writer, Benigni (with Vincenzo Cerami), doesn't just mix drama and comedy, he often hides drama in the comedy... The film does not dwell on the horrors of the camp, nor does it ignore them... With a memorable score by Nicola Piovani, \"Life Is Beautiful\" is an important film, triumphant, timeless, and sublime... It manages to entertain, educate, and move with its potent combination of humor, poignancy, and dignity... Roberto Benigni has taken pure horror and turned it into a love story between a man and a woman, between a father and his son... As an actor, Benigni manages with his wise and simple performance to make us laugh in tragic situations... He was very realistic, natural, distant from great special effects, far from Hollywood style, only nice and beautiful cinema...The film won Academy Awards for Best Actor, Best Foreign Film and Best Dramatic Score..."

            "Review": "This is one of those movies that have a lasting effect on you.   After watching it, I found that it has less to do with the Holocaust and more to do with the human feelings and the beautiful relationship of a father and his son.  The holocaust provides the ultimate context, that brings and highlights the story and adds yet another deep dimension to the movie.  No such piece of art has ever before combined laughter and tears of sadness in me before and that is the miracle of the movie.  The realism of the movie is not its strong point, but then again it is  not supposed to be; this helps in bringing the audiences to a state of mind away from reality, focusing on the feelings generated by forgetting about all external events and developments of the war.  Despite that, the movie does not fail to point out an element of the nazi psychology demonstrated by the doctor who was obsessed with riddles.  This portrayed the nazi 'state of mind' (if ever such an expression existed) as a sick mentally disturbed state.  Life is really beautiful as you watch Guido's relentless efforts to make a lovely exciting experience of the concentration camp to his son.  You get exhausted just watching him going through his painful day and yet you smile as he speaks to his son and makes him laugh.  One can go on forever  describing the creativity of this movie, but one will not be able to capture all its beauty in writing."

            "Review": "Roberto Benigni's Vita e bella, is in many ways similar to Chaplin's Great Dictator.  Both are comic attacks on fascism, but the former's is the more successful.  Benigni initially accesses the emotions of his audience through simple comedy, which is a pleasant mix of Keaton and Chaplin.  Romance ensues with his real life wife Nicoletta Braschi.  The first half of this film has been seen by various critics as being inferior to the second, but this is certainly not the case.  In the first section we follow the delightful romance that will eventually lead to marriage and the creation of the wonderful Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini).It is the first half where the audience can laugh the loudest and delight at the immense comedy talent of Benigni.  Unlike so many films nowadays there is nothing crude or course, his is simple innocent humour, which is all the more effective.  The way he ties together little strand in the film to create comedy elements shows a great writing ability, and a mastery of timing when it comes to their execution on screen.  Various incidents related to the rise of anti-semitism and fascism in Italy show that there are sinister forces at work which come to the fore in the second segment.Guido (Benigni) moves events on from Tuscany in 1939 to the last year of the war in a concentration camp.  In this period he and Dora (Braschi) have had their son Giosue (Cantanarini).  The five year old greatly reminds me of Toto in Cinema Paradiso, and plays an equally important role in his prospective film (though in Paradiso's case it is at the beginning of the movie).  The relationship between the two is very similar to that of Jackie Coogan and Charlie Chaplin (though Benigni, unlike Chaplin, keeps the best of the comedy moments).  Guido attempts to keep from the boy the horrors of what is going on, and this eventually manifests itself as a game where the aim is to score 100 points, with the winner winning a real tank (which, of course appeals to the young boy).  Comic moments are still present, that involving Guido's translation of the rules of the camp is particularly notable, but it becomes somewhat more difficult to laugh when we consider the gravity of what is going on.The emphasis begins shifts, and we realise that this is a film about human spirit above all else.  Guido not only appeals to the audience due to his comedy and sheer pleasantness, but also in the way that he loves his family and the measures that he will go to to protect them.This is certainly no Schindler's List, but it never pretends to be. Occasionally events seem a little contrived, but this does seem to work in the film's favour.  However, this film avoids the tendency of Hollywood to go far over the top in emotional and credibility terms.Benigni shines like a lantern throughout the picture, showing that he is a talent, not only in comedy terms, that far outshines his peers.  Cantanari is a delight, and Braschi also plays her part well.  There is even an appearance by The Magnificent Seven's Horst Buchholz as Doctor Lessing, a man who events change for the worse.Please don't let the fact that it, to all but the Italians, is a foreign language film.  The language itself adds a beauty of form to the film, much as it did in the case of Il Postino.  This has to be a certainty for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, though something tells me that it will be overlooked for other awards as it is Italian and not a mainstream English language picture.Please see this film, and make up your own mind.  It is appealing in so many different ways that I'm sure that you will not be disappointed."

            "Review": "I have never in my life seen a movie that so truly symbolizes its name and its message. Roberto Benigni - 'The Italian Treasure House' has probably given to his viewers his best. The story, the performances, the entire theme of a person performing his duties as a husband, as a father is very 'moving' and inspiring. 'Life is beautiful' as the name goes is about a Jewish man, who falls in love with a non-Jewish lady, marries her, has a kid and who is then taken as a prisoner in a concentration camp along with his wife and kid. But the way he protects his kid from the horrors of the genocide, how he always tries to find ways to make his wife and kid smile and laugh, is what makes the movie, a MUST SEE.It is certainly one of the best movies that I have seen."

            "Review": "Life Is Beautiful takes the premise that love and hope can survive the most trying of conditions, in this case a Nazi concentration camp. Most everyone knows this very popular and honored film, so I won't belabor the story. Briefly, in my humble opinion, this film deserves all the accolades it's been awarded. A near perfect film, my only gripe is that Mr. Benigni's performance could have been more understated, especially the half of the film that's set in the concentration camp. But this is only a slight complaint. For a joyful, life-affirming movie, Life Is Beautiful is tops. But be forewarned, as its principal backdrop of anti-Semitism and Nazi murder, it is not a very happy movie."

            "Review": "Victims of The Holocaust, and placed in a concentration camp, Guido tries to make life bearable for his young son, and those around him.A fathers love truly can make the most horrendous situation, bearable. This is one of the most original, unique war films of all time, and whilst I know subtitles are a challenge for some, I beg you to stick with it, as it is a truly unique experience.This powerful film takes you on a rollercoaster journey, elevating you to real highs, then sinking you to painful lows. After a truly fun, amusing start, it changes into something very different, and you get a true sense of the misery The Nazis caused.Roberto Benigni gives a quite captivating performance as Guido, perfectly cast, he has charm, charisma, he's funny, and able to switch it up in a second.Wonderful visuals, as you'd expect, it's beautifully well made, produced with flair and style, even the scenes inside the camp.Quite an experience.9/10."

I can see how some people might not experience the same kind of uplift or joy that most of us lived through when seeing the movie.  But that some viewers felt insulted and betrayed because the movie did not depict \"reality\" as it really was or is, is not fair.I must concur with my fellow proponents of the movie -- it was a great and very satisfying movie.  It provided me with something that everyone in one or another shape or form needs -- Hope.  The movie showed the cruelty of life and yet managed to shed some light and insight into the beauty of love and life in general.I urge anyone who has not seen La Vita \u00e8 bella to go out there and watch it. If we all take with us just little bit of that hope and love that this movie is trying to convey; this world would be a much better place.\nThank you for reading this and I hope you enjoyed or will enjoy the movie as much as I did."

            "Review": "I typically don't care much for sub-titled movies.  Foreign films to me are slow and about nothing.  So I naturally went to see Life is Beautiful with a chip on my shoulder.  I wanted to hate it.  I wanted it to be just another movie that Hollywood was praising to show that they were an intelligent bunch of people.  Oh boy was I in for the surprise of my life.  Not only is this film good, I honestly believe that it was the second best film of 98, next to Saving Private Ryan.  The mere fact that Shakespeare in Love won best picture over not only Ryan but over this, is a joke.  It's actually funny.Benigni did everything in this film.  He wrote, produced, directed and probably swept the floors at night.  There is that much raw energy in this film.  There really is.  For someone to have that kind of vision is truly incredible.  And not only is the film a terrific cinematic experience because of the importance and seriousness of the subject matter, but it is one of the funnier films I've ever seen.  When Roberto is translating the German soldiers insructions to his son so that he isn't scared, it is at that moment that you realize you are under his spell.  He's got you and no matter how much sceptisism you may have about the film you know you're witnessing a classic in every sense of the word.I loved this film.  Loved everything about it and I am so glad that I got to see it and cheer Benigni at the Oscars.  He certainly deserved his best actor award and he should have gotten more."

            "Review": "\"Life is Beautiful\" is more than a masterpiece. It is possibly THE most incredibly wonderful movie that exists. Guido Orefice (Roberto Benigni) is a Jewish waiter in 1930s Italy. He has managed to hide his ethnic background, although he is fully aware of the anti-Semitism around him (one man has sons named Adolf and Benito). To counter Mussolini's nationalism, he goes to a school to \"prove\" that the Italians are a superior race: he shows off his bellybutton. After some flings with \"principesa\" Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), the two of them get married and have a son named Giosue (called Joshua in the subtitles).A few years later, the Nazis are rounding up all the Jews in town, including Guido and Giosue (Dora demands to be taken also). But Guido has the most imaginative plan: he tells Giosue that they are playing a game. In what may be the movie's most surprising scene, they enter a barracks where everyone is wearing those suits that we've seen in footage of concentration camps, and Guido \"translates\" for the Nazi guard: he announces how they are participating in this game to see who can get the most points, and you lose points for being a crybaby, asking to see your mommy, or asking for food. You are quite literally assuming that he can't pull it off, but he does masterfully.Throughout the whole movie, you keep expecting that he's eventually going to go over the edge, but he never does. \"Life is Beautiful\" is more than beautiful. Benigni's Oscars for Best Actor and Best Foreign Language Film were probably the most well-deserved Oscars in recent years. If you ask me, the movie should have won Best Picture, and every other possible Oscar. It is a work of pure genius."

            "Review": "Before I eventually saw this film, I was not sure whether I was going to like it or not. While in general it is very highly regarded, there have been those who have said it is overrated or whatever. Just for the record, I did like the movie very much. It is uneven, and there were parts that didn't work as well as intended, but this is a brave and affectionate realisation of life during the Holocaust. I asked myself after watching Life is Beautiful, is it really overrated. Well, maybe a tad, but I can really see why people like this movie.So what didn't make this film perfect? Well, as I have stated at least twice already, it is uneven. And in my humble opinion, the second half was better than the first. I just want to clarify that I didn't hate the first half. Some of it is very funny, but some of the slapstick humour didn't work as well as it should, namely eggs breaking on people's heads. It also works very hard, to provide charm. That is perfectly acceptable, but because there was a lot of charm in the performances and the production values it felt slightly overdone. Though I will say that Benigni's tribute to comedy greats like Charlie Chaplin and Groucho Marx was inspired.The film changes tone to a more poignant, compelling and harrowing second half, that I think was much needed. While the character of Guido \"amusingly\" tries to convince his son Giosue that life in the concentration isn't so bad, the second half's tone has a lot of poignancy. Most notably Guido and Giosue trying to communicate to Dora over the loudspeaker, and the ending did have me in tears.That said, there are a lot of truly good things about Life is Beautiful. For one thing, it is sumptuously filmed. The costumes look amazing and the Italian landscapes look breathtaking. (If there is one place that I would love, love, LOVE to go to it is Italy, not only for the food but for the opera as well.) The story is an effective and affectionate one, about a Jewish man who falls in love with the help of his humour, but has to do the same to protect his son in the Nazi concentration camp. The quality of the script, I saw the Italian version with English subtitles, is thoroughly decent, and hits more than it misses.The performances are excellent in general. Roberto Benigni, one of Italy's favourite funny men, gives a admirable performance. He does overact at times in the first half but he appears a lot more subdued in the second. And I also thought he did a better job acting than he did directing. His direction once or twice in this film was a tad stodgy. Nicoletta Braschi is just stunning as Dora, she looked amazing in this movie and was solid in terms of acting. Giorgio Cantarini didn't always convince as Giosue though, there were times when he comes across as whiny and maybe I am being unfair but I have seen better child performances.All in all, beautiful to watch, and a nice story. It is very pleasant to watch with a compelling and poignant second half, but there are flaws that bring it down from what could have been outstanding to just a film worth watching. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

            "Review": "The first time I saw the movie was when I was about seventeen or so, and I never forgot it. The incredibly human characters (such as the doctor who loved riddles), the fantastic script-writing, the amazing acting, and of course the heartwarming story. This movie proves once and for all how strong we are, as humans, that in the face of adversity we can make the best of things. There is so much love in the characters; Dora's love for her husband Guido is boundless, as well as Guido's love for his son. Sure, it's a slightly unrealistic movie, but hey, aren't they all a little unrealistic? I've also seen people review this movie and say that it made light of the Holocaust, which was of course a dark point in history. I don't think so; I think that it's only delicately handled, and because of that, the movie is one that a person can watch in one sitting without being thoroughly disgusted by mankind. I would say that those who think this movie is too \"light\" are cynical and bitter. The whole point to the movie is to show what love is capable of, and to provide encouragement and perhaps guidance. This movie changed my life from the first time I watched it. I came away with this feeling that no matter what I have to face in life, that I can overcome it. This is a movie that I would recommend to anyone over the age of eleven. The acting is superb (though Roberto Benigni is a little over-the-top, LOL), the story heartwarming and easy to understand. It's excellent!"

            "Review": "When I first saw this film, I was told up front that the first full hour of the film, the first half, was all slapstick comedy and character development, and that the second half was more serious and important. I prepared myself mentally for the first half, but I was still surprised by how annoying the gags and jokes were. We're talking cake-in-face, fall-over, slip-on-banana humor. For one full hour. At the end of the first half of this film, I was thinking \"this had better get better very soon...\" And it did. Right then and there. From the very beginning of the second half, the serious mood enters. And it doesn't take long for even the most average minded viewer to realize that the first half of humor and character development was important. It was important for us to ease into a less tense mood, to make the important subject strike even harder, and for us to get to know the characters, to make us care more about what happens to them. I've just finished seeing it for the second time, and I've come to realize that this film is not entirely perfect, as I felt just after seeing it through first time. It does have its flaws, though there aren't many of them. The first half, and some parts of the second half, are heavy on humor, which some will mistake for making fun of the subject(which is almost a crime), or trying to make it seem less important. I don't believe this to be true, it's just a retelling with a more positive message; yes, people do horrible, inhumane things sometimes... but after all, there is beauty, too. The first half will also deter some viewers who will enjoy the second half much more. The plot is very good, though slightly unrealistic. The acting is pretty much all flawless, even in the child actors. The characters are well-written and interesting. The humor is more acceptable in the second part, because it's more toned down and not trying way too hard to get a quick laugh out of the audience. All in all, a great film which anyone and everyone should see at least once during their life... you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll realize that, in the end, Life Is Beautiful. I recommend this to just about anyone, but I know that not everyone will enjoy it equally. A near-perfect film. Keep watching past the first half... you won't regret it. 9/10"

It's a powerful and moving film about the power of family and what one man will do when that family is threatened. The plot is as follows: after Germans attack Italy, Guido and his family are forced into a concentration camp. Guido spends most of the rest of the film desperately trying to convince his young son that the holocaust is nothing but a game- and that the child has to keep out of sight in order to win. He promises him that the winner will earn a full size tank- and the boy does get a tank at the end of the film, just not in the way he thinks he will. The first hour or so is pure slapstick/romantic comedy, and the second hour or so is moving and heartbreaking- with touches of humor to(I assume) keep the audience from becoming too depressed or disturbed. I was amazed at how it could dramatically shift from comedy to drama so quickly. Try to watch this film without crying. If you don't, even just a bit, there's something seriously wrong with you."

            "Review": "Wonderful fable plenty of amazing fantasy, lively comedy and sad tragedy . This is a poignant and moving fable about a sacrifice to save a son and a wife . It's an unforgettable story formed by two halves that proves imagination, family and love conquer all ; as Benigni's focus is on the love between daddy , mummy and son . The first part results to be an Italian comedy style , the second is horror along with humor . It concerns upon Guido (Roberto Benigni, a magnificent rubber-faced funny man), a Jewish man who has a wonderful romance with the help of his humour, but must use that same quality to protect his son in a Nazi death camp . He's a madcap romantic man and women wish him . But he falls in love with Dora (Benigni's real-life sweetie Nicoletta Braschi). Every day Guido dreams of marrying her , under Nicola Piovani score . When the Second World War spontaneously breaks out , he and his family is imprisoned at concentration camp . Guido is determined to save his lover and son (Cantarini) from dangers around them . His effort sometimes is pure fantasy , though with ruse he pull off more impetus to keep his son and accomplishes feats no man could realistically execute . Guido fabricates an elaborated game to convince his child that the whole ordeal is an endurance proof to be won with prizes forthcoming , as it turns out to be a special contest to win a tank.This is a story about love , war and sacrifice , well starred and directed by Roberto Benigni who develops a fire-line between comedy and tragedy . Inventive gags and wacky humor are splendidly proceeded . At first consideration , the theme of a feel-good holocaust comedy war was a non-sense . However , Benigni doesn't describe a holocaust film but rather a tale of endurance of family love . Benigni tirelessly maintains the humorous ingenuity, even as the horror war escalates. Actor and director Benigni shapes simultaneously haunting and hilarious comedy out of the tragedy of Nazi concentration camp . In a especially humorous scene , Guido translates a guard's barking at the inmates as furthers clarification of the rules of game . The picture is divided into two parts , the first half deals with an entertaining boy-meets-girl tale , a light-weight comedy in which Guido relentlessly pursues Dora ; the second half shifts and depicts the horrors of the concentration camps . Good support cast formed by notorious secondaries as the Spanish Marisa Paredes , Lidia Alfonsi and Horst Buchhold as a Nazi doctor . The film displays an emotive musical score by Nicola Piovani, who deservedly had Oscar winner . Furthermore , it won Academy Award to Foreign film and of course to Benigni ; Roberto Benigni's Oscar for best actor marked only the second time that an actor had directed himself in an Academy Award winning performance , the other was Laurence Olivier for Hamlet . Colorful and glamorous cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli . Effective and appropriate production design by the veteran Danilo Donati . The motion picture was marvelously directed by Benigni. He's a good comedy director (Monster, Johnny Toothpick, Little devil) with some flop (Pinoccio) and usual actor for Jim Jarmusch (Coffee and cigarettes, Night of Earth, Down by law). Rating : Better than average . Well worth seeing ."

            "Review": "Remember when Roberto Benigni's name was announced as winner of the Best Actor Oscar? He was literally jumping out of his skin to be declared the winner. It perfectly resonated with the character he portrayed in \"Life is Beautiful\". Now I understand why he was so excited, as I hadn't seen the film until now.Not knowing anything about the story, I thought the first half of the movie was wonderfully whimsical and creative, especially with the way Guido managed to manipulate outcomes in his quest to win Dora (Nicoletta Braschi). The writing for these sequences was genuinely inspired with priceless comic touches that warm the heart. The Prince wins his Princess and all is well in the world.I wasn't quite sure how to process events in the second half of the movie, knowing that such antics as displayed by Guido could certainly never have occurred in a Nazi concentration camp. But I kept coming back to an early statement Uncle Elisio (Giustino Dorano) made to Guido quoted in my summary line above. Perhaps the second half of the film is totally unrealistic, but it was necessary for the film makers to get away with this technique to make their case for finding and keeping hope in an impossible situation. Not only did Guido insure that his young son Joshua (Giorgio Canterini) would survive the ordeal, but actually flourish in a hostile environment until the war ended.If I had my preference, Guido would have survived the concentration camp as well since this is a fictional story. But perhaps it's better that some heartbreak was mingled with the joy of Joshua reuniting with his mother. The ending reinforces the idea that joy and sorrow both exist in the world for everyone in different degrees and at different times and that life is not a hopeless condition. Rather a journey to be lived to the fullest with freedom secure in one's own heart."

            "Review": "Contains Spoiler Every once in a while a movie comes along which makes you question the kind of man you are. How do you handle situations? If you were put in the same situation, Would you come out of it smiling? Do you have the courage? Guido (Benigni) did. Life is beautiful charms you right from the opening shot of the beautiful Italian countryside. It takes you into the life of Guido, a young Italian Jewish Waiter who has a beautiful way of looking at things. he never seems to look at anmything negatively, in fact, his frivolous view to life is what makes you sit riveted throughout. I don't think he's delusional, he is a very serious man, and he sees the gravity of situations in his life, but he doesn't want the people around him to feel it, hence his ever-smiling, effervescent demeanour. It all seems like a fairy tale. His landing into the school as the impostor school inspector and lecture on the virtues of the navel... His galloping down into the ballroom on the horse and whisking his bride away towards a happy life... His superspeed bike ride down the town square... things that we all dream of. An untouched innocence. The movie takes a dramatic turn when he finds himself in a concentration camp with his son... His made up story of how the camp is a game and the father-son team are the leading competitors... An unmatched courage. Not one to cry in movies as a rule, I found myself alone at home one day, and when the boy is hidden in the little box, looking at his father being led away at gun point, getting scared... and then, the father doing what he usually does to reassure the boy that the situation is not as serious as it looks... the clown march... I felt tears roll down my cheeks. And then, i started sniffing... after a while, the sniffs turn into sobs, and ultimately, when his father is dead, and the boy sees the American tank coming towards him, the elation in his eyes, the jubilation at winning first prize... it turned the sobs into a full fledged howl.

In short, a dad convinces his son that the concentration camp they're in is actually a game where he wins a tank if they get the most points. All while finding ways to show his wife he's still alive. The first hour of the movie is a little slow, but shows subtle ways nazis are affecting Italy. Then the last 30 minutes are just tear jerkingly painful. My jaw never left the floor all while I cried like a baby. Perfect in every sense of the word."

            "Review": "I am remarkably stingy with my 10/10 ratings. I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. Of the roughly 2600 titles I've rated on here, only 34 have a 10.\nParasite is one of them. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.I'm going to keep it vague on the plot-front, because I didn't know anything about it going in, and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.What I will say is that this film, more than just about any other I've seen, put me through so many different emotional states during its 132-minute runtime, and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent. Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I'm honestly not sure if I've felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013).And it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast. All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree; the amount of conflict, drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering. You come to care for just about all of them.I'm stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie. And sure, I've seen many movies that are hard to fault, but it's rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect. It's extremely entertaining, thoroughly moving in so many different ways, and as icing on the cake there's a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie's over (and this one's not going to leave my head for a while, I can tell).Catch this one when you can and believe the hype. Joon-Ho Bong has made many great films (and so far no bad one's), but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others.When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was, this one will surely be up there."

The movie starts out almost like an 'Ocean's Eleven' heist film and then expands into a comedy, mystery, thriller, drama, romance, crime and even horror film. It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too.I love a film that respects its audience. There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats. There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch-ability factor will be very high.The film was incredibly entertaining too. I can't think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening, at least in terms of action. Fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this. I had a great time with 'Parasite' and I think most that give it a chance will too."

            "Review": "In a meritocracy, success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it--those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, and for some lucky Cinderella, plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns, the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society: \"I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired; you, too, can achieve you dreams, if only you try.\"The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition, backstabbing, deceit, and callousness. You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one, and then, perhaps, when you at last feel secure, you can afford to be kind and confident and generous. \"It's easy to be nice when you're rich,\" the mother in this film (Jang Hye-jin) at one point observes.But it's a very long and very crooked ladder, and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip, and sometimes they've been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you, and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down--either by those above you or, just as often, by those staring up from the ground below. There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder.But in a meritocracy, you can't blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it. Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it. No, you must blame yourself. You should have tread more carefully. You should have climbed more quickly. You should have used a firmer and more precise grip, anticipated disasters, and known just when to leap. If you fail in a meritocracy, it's all your fault. You should have tried harder. Better luck next time.Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), the young man who is the main character of PARASITE, several times refers to \"metaphors,\" and the film itself is, of course, a metaphor. On a surface level, viewers are treated to a very thrilling, engaging, well-paced and well-plotted crime story. At all times, however, bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film, there are deeply personal, meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer. These insights are rarely foregrounded. They are so subtly interwoven, in fact, that if you're like me, you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate, humanist story you've just witnessed. Bong Joon-ho's filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he'll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he's done so.I want to avoid spoilers here, but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece--beautifully lensed, enthrallingly edited, superbly acted, and intimately involving.South Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States, and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky. Higher education is widespread, so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs. I lived in Korea once, and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week--public school, English-immersion private school, piano class, soccer team, taekwondo, math camp, chess club, and so on. I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary, but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that, who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long. As the father (Song Kang-ho) in the film at one point says, this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job. One can't afford not to struggle.The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, however. They are the story of global capitalism, and the specter of American materialism (and imperialism; note the \"Indians\") looms heavily over the film. Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all. It's nice to dream, and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine, and how nice an ending it is when they do. But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be, maybe, just whims and fancy. More often, it seems, our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage."

He's had his ups and downs over the years, although they've generally been ups rather than downs, but this is perhaps his towering masterpiece. It's a quiet and reflective work, his maturist yet, a parable playing out which looks at class divide in a scathing and extremely telling way. The issue is universal, which is why this film did so well abroad (and at the Oscars), although I've been championing the quality of South Korean cinema for a long time. The technical qualities are exemplary and the acting is particularly astounding, with an unusual storyline building to an unexpected climax. A film that thoroughly entertains as well as making you think."

            "Review": "It's not really a review but my attempt to explain how I interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated, especially if the reason is that they didn't like the second half of it.It's much easier to understand the message of a movie when the 'good guys' win or the 'bad guys' get punished in the end. I'm not saying that all Hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values. But still, I believe that Parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which there's a character with a clearer 'moral center' whom audiences can easily relate to. So, I think it's no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiences.Some complained that they don't understand Ki-Taek's motive for killing Mr. Park. But to fully appreciate this, you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is, \"crossing the line\".It's a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other people's privacy or as one should mind one's own (social) position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position. If interpreted as the latter meaning, it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative, along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families' respective dwellings.It would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged, but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner. But the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if Bong Joon-Ho chose such a path, and he is too good a director not to see such a danger.Instead, he chose to make Mr. Park a reasonable enough character, despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature. He seems to treat Ki-Taek fairly enough at first, but he also warns the latter not to 'cross the line' if Ki-Taek attempts to pry into his private life.At first, it seems that it's quite easy for Ki-Taek and other members of his family to sneak into Mr. Park's house in various roles and mingle with them. Ki-Taek even compliments how nice Mr. Park's family is, but his premature admiration soon gets challenged when he overheard, when he was hiding under the table, what Mr. Park really thinks of him - almost a different species of the human being who doesn't even smell like him.Ki-Taek's final disillusionment came when Mr. Park cringes from the smell of the dead basement dweller and shows much more concern for his son's shock while virtually ignoring Ki-Taek's daughter's status who's dying on the ground, spurting blood from the stab wound.That moment, Ki-Taek realizes how Mr. Park sees him and his whole family as not an equal human being, but something much more insignificant.And he also realizes the 'line' that separates the two families is not just that of courtesy or proper social behaviour. Instead, it is a line that can even determine the life of those 'lesser' human beings to be less important than the passing unpleasant feelings or mental shock of those 'proper' human beings.However easy it was for Ki-Taek's family to sneak into Mr. Park's house, or however they try to socialize and mingle with Mr. Park's family, their existence is no better than that of a 'parasite', which is also visualized so effectively by the presence of the hidden basement room inside the house.With such disillusionment and anger, Ki-Taek chose to kill Mr. Park, as a parasite could to its host, and like a parasite, he keeps hiding deep inside the dead host's body until he could claim the whole of the carcass and use it as nourishment for his offsprings.The tragedy was not something caused by any exceptional defect or vice of either Mr. Park's or Ki-Taek's personalities. Instead, it's a 'line' drawn by an invisible hand, separating those classes according to their respective social conditions, which can be so brutal as to be able to deprive the two families of their humanity in contrasting manners. And that is what I believe to be the message this film is trying to convey.Of course, not every movie must make a commentary on society rather than providing a care-free pastime that everyone can understand.But without if the movie didn't change its gear in the second half to shed light on a serious inherent problem of our society, it would be just another heist gone wrong type comedy, instead of a deserving candidate to be called the best film of the year."

So he and his layabout family get all the help fired; his sister is hired as an art psychologist to help the sister, the father as the new chauffeur, and the mother as the cook/housekeeper. Yet even though you don't see them, there are vermin living in the foundations, and they come out when the people in charge aren't around.It's a movie that starts out as a situation comedy and then abruptly changes gears into horror, with a script that handles the theme of the people we don't see because they're not our problem in a way that jostles the boundaries of symbolic and mimetic fiction in a very disturbing fashion. When I saw it in a theater during its New York run, I was impressed. I was convinced it would be nominated for Best Foreign Movie, and might even win!"

            "Review": "As a film about a family imposing on another, and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface, Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us: tell a multi-layered story in a widely entertaining manner, but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative.That's not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means, but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare, writer-director Bong Joon-ho is in a class of his own.The film follows a lower-class South Korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upper-class family and their lavish household. As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances.It's a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts.However, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times. Go in blind if you can and expect an unforgettable ride."

            "Review": "There is no shortage of films that depict the injustice of social inequality but originality is scarce. With a large proportion of its population below the poverty line, it is noteworthy that a filmmaker from South Korea has produced a work that has attracted almost universal acclaim. Parasite (2019)generates a great deal of conversation but be warned: it is not a film for everyone, especially those averse to gory endings.If you step back from the story's twists and turns, the narrative premise is simple. A family of petty crooks living in abject poverty get lucky as, one by one, each tricks their way into being employed by the same heartlessly wealthy family in roles like tutor, driver, and housekeeper. The gullible family is easy to deceive, while the crooks manufacture various scenarios to their own advantage. The occupation of the luxurious home by the crooks adds a new meaning to the concept of home invasion. However, the plan comes un-stuck when they find a secret dungeon that leads to horrific consequences.The film takes too much time in developing the central premise and various sub-plots, and more descriptive prose could be offered here about what actually happens. But that is not the point of the film. Director Joon-ho Bong paints an intricate portrait of the normalisation of poverty and class privilege, with both sets of family never questioning their place in South Korea's social order. This acceptance and its destructiveness of the human spirit makes change impossible and condemns Korean society to moral bankruptcy.There is more to this film than political discourse. As a black comedy, it is sprinkled with funny although improbable moments and the filming style expresses the polemic in obvious ways. Juxtaposing the world occupied by a smelly cramped underclass with the opulent world of the rich is low-hanging fruit. One can also find elements of magical fantasy, as it requires an unequivocal suspension of disbelief to accept that a family of losers can so easily dupe a family of high achievers. The acting tends towards wooden, and it is difficult to warm to any particular character. The film's climax offers little other than an ambivalent balance between hope and nihilism, leaving viewers to decide which family are the parasites.For many, the critical pendulum swings towards the 'masterpiece' label. But it is perhaps closer to reality to describe this as an original, engaging, and disturbing tale of endemic class tension, oppression, and helplessness. Although tenuous, the message has universal relevance."

It is a stark reminder of what true living standards for most South Koreans look like, and its realism is very painful. Few are aware of the fact that up to the 1980s, South Korea was in fact more impoverished than North Korea, and it was only late that the situation reversed with famines of the 90s etc, but many people still live miserable lives, and situation is very similar to that in China, where a few got gloriously rich but the urban masses still live in bug infested cheap dwellings.Some crafty members of this underclass manage to con contemptuous rich man into employing them as his servants. For many Asians smell is a way to express utter contempt, and this is often directed against the white people, who, being able to process milk, smell \"like butter\" and are seen in rac ist light as unclean, but the same rac ist contempt is directed towards the poor. The poor accept these valuations and fight for the crumbles, like roaches in the dark, but in life and death situations, resentment might boil up and the contempt might cost the rich their empty heads.The movie paints a sad picture of modern East Asian societies, with many subtle points, criticizes their culture and emulation of the America, with a few cruel but precise strokes. The sheer talent of the Korean filmmaker, but also the fact that West likes movies from foreign countries that are self bashing, allowing the worst condescension rooted in colonialism that failed miserably in East Asia to thrive, one more reason to cheer this slightly overrated movie."

It's one of those films that's almost impossibility to classify, it doesn't really fit into any specific genre, but covers almost all of them.A great start, it holds your attention incredibly well, I enjoyed the latter stages as much as the first part of the film, I know some didn't. It just moves you into a totally different place.You'll laugh, and cry, you'll lose yourself in the wonder. Do yourself a favour and order it, 10/10."

As a fan of Korean thrillers, this film surpassed my expectations.\nThe film is about a poor family who cleverly n cunningly become employed by a wealthy couple, posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.The film begins like a dark satire, it then proceeds into a captivating thriller n ends like a surreal crime.The film is very entertaining inspite of the sad stuff shown about poor fellas but mind u, it is not at all demeaning. It is very gripping n weirdly hilarious."

            "Review": "A family who doesn't have a lot of money or opportunities in life, starts working for a wealthy family. But will this change the life of the poor family?DIRECTOR: Bong Joon Ho\nSCREENWRITERS: Bong Joon Ho, Han Jin Wan\nCAST: Song Kang Ho, Lee Sun Kyun, Cho Yeo Jeong, Choi Woo Shik, Park So Dam, Lee Jung Eun, Chang Hyae Jin\nIn the movie, we follow the Kim family who doesn't have much money. By chance, the son in the family starts working for the wealthy Park family. He teaches their daughter English. Now the rest of the family sees opportunities to make money, and they have a plan to remove the rest of the staff who work for the wealthy Park family and then take the jobs themselves.Bong Joon Ho addresses deeper themes, but he always manages to create entertainment and some surprising scenes that bring out the smile. The movie is mostly charming until the Kim family discovers the big secret of the house.Then the movie starts to get darker, and it explodes into a wonderful finale where we see and understand the message of the movie. The title of the movie turns things on its head. Because what I thought to be quite obvious at the beginning of the movie is turned upside down and I got an aha experience. Parasites are found in all classes of society.From a technical aspect I think this was a beautifully crafted film from the direction to the cinematography. There are so many beautiful scenes in the movie, and it's pretty well done considering that most of the action takes place inside the big house and the not so big garden.My favorite sequence is when the Kim family has to run home when the rain is pouring down, and you feel like they're on board the Titanic. They must run from the top and down to the engine room. What a wonderful sequence, and it's so beautiful to watch!The cast was fantastic, and everyone fit the needs of their roles. The characters were well-written with the performances complementing that perfectly. It does a great job of creating a collection of characters that feel like real people, whom despite their eccentricities, maintained a grounded, realistic feel.The musical score complements the scenes nicely and elevates the emotional responses without feeling overbearing.So, if you like foreign films, thrillers, or movies that can make you think a little check this one out. It's a crisp film from a technical aspect, and with a blend of great writing and acting you can't go wrong. It was a solid film that treats the audience with intelligence. 9/10"

            "Review": "This movie is so masterfully written and presented with a large cast that older audiences will realize how rare movies like this have become. Its enjoyment comes from getting to know the members of two extremely different families, one very poor, the other very rich. How their lives come together is the wickedly enjoyable first half; then, in the second half the house of cards begins to shake and finally collapse with a fury we both dread - and perhaps even enjoy. Though our enjoyment probably has as much to do with the movie-making skills than with the nasty turn of events in the violent final scenes.\nIf you see only one foreign language film this year, this should be it. Exciting and provocative throughout, it is wonderfully acted and packed with significance for all who live in a polarized society where so many live in luxury, while others live in comparative squalor just a few blocks away. Deserves all the accolades it has already - and surely will continue - to receive."

            "Review": "Parasite became the first foreign language film to win the Best Picture Oscar. The first third of the film had me wondering why.The film opens in a dilapidated, smelly semi basement in South Korea. The Kim family is so poor that they need to borrow a neighbour's wifi and lose it when it becomes password protected. They make a living by folding cardboard pizza boxes.Dad, Ki-taek is the weak link. He cannot even fold the boxes properly so their meagre wages are deducted. Son, Ki-woo gets a stroke of fortune, when a friend helps him get a well paid tutoring job with a fake diploma. Ki-woo tutors the daughter of of the wealthy Park family who live in a lavish mansion. Soon Ki-woo gets his sister Ki-jung a job as an art tutor for the disruptive younger son.The wily Ki-jung conspires to get the Park's family chauffeur fired and have him replaced by their father. Before long they manoeuvre to get the housekeeper dismissed by preying on her allergy to peaches and be replaced by their mother Chung-sook.All of them claim to be strangers to the Park family, pretty soon the Kim's are earning good money and living well. They are street smart who have taken advantage of the naivety of the wealthy Parks.Their good fortune is threatened when one night when the Park's are away on a break, the former housekeeper returns looking for something she left behind.I thought the movie would turn out to be similar to Joseph Losey's The Servant which was scripted by Harold Pinter. It goes in that direction but then swerves off.When Bong Joon Ho accepted his best director Oscar he publicly thanked Martin Scorsese. It was his movies Bong studied in film school. The key is Scorsese's own British influences ranging from Ealing Films, Hitchcock to Powell & Pressburger.There is a parasite in the Park household but the film is about class. A fatalistic, metaphorical dark comedy which morphs into a twisted blood soaked tragedy.Parasite has a heightened reality, the Parks are wealthy who never look down even in their own house as they have no need to. They are nice but when one of them inadvertently mentions the odour of ordinary working people, like those who travel in crowded tube trains, they seal their fate.Bong shows that those in the bottom rung of South Korean society cannot advance very far. Ki-woo has a dream but it is more likely to be dashed, fate and fortune will ensure of that."

            "Review": "South Korean director Bong Joon-ho (\"Okja\") says that he always tries to overturn viewer expectations and hopes that his latest film succeeds in this way. Palme d'Or winner at the 2019 Cannes Film festival, Bong's Parasite (Gisaengchung) does indeed thwart expectations, but the question is - to what end? Defying any strict genre classification, the film is a conglomeration of comedy, drama, satire, crime, horror, and anything else you can throw into the mix. Bong sees the film as a statement about the \"ranks and classes\" inherent in capitalism that are invisible to the eye, and says that the film \"depicts the inevitable cracks that appear when two classes brush up against each other in today's increasingly polarized society.\" Unfortunately, the characterizations are filled with so many stereotypes that the lack of any realistic human dimension leaves Bong's statement without much impact.The film looks at class differences between two families - one well-to-do, and the other n'eer do well. For the Kim family, life is a struggle. They live in a cramped bug-infested basement apartment without many amenities except for a toilet built on kind of a shelf. The father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho, \"Snowpiercer\") has failed in business and has accumulated many debts. His son and daughter Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik, \"Train to Busan\") and Ki-jung (Park So-dam, \"Cinderella and Four Knights\" TV series) have repeatedly failed college entrance exams. The mother Chung-sook (Hyae-jin Jang, \"Adulthood\") along with the two children fold boxes for a delivery company, but cannot even get that right. Not to worry, they leave their windows open when the fumigators come around to get some free extermination and steal free Wi-Fi from the next door coffee shop.On the other hand, the nouveau riche Park family has all the advantages. Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun, \"Jo Pil-ho: The Dawning Rage\") is the CEO of a high-tech company and the family lives in a spacious, modernistic home protected by sturdy concrete walls. He has an attractive somewhat fragile wife Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong, \"The Target\"), a teenage daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so, \"The Tiger\"), and a hyper-active young son Da-song (Jung Hyun-jun). Being wealthy and somewhat elitist in their attitude, for Bong, they are ideally suited to be torn apart by ruthless grifters. With the aid of a friend, Ki-woo is hired to be a private tutor for Da-hye. Of course, he has to forge university documents to convince the trusting Mrs. Park of his competence. With that conquest out of the way, the cunning Ki-woo concocts a scheme to secure jobs in the Park household for his entire family.Convinced that their young son is a budding Picasso, Mrs. Park hires Ki-jung as an art teacher, then falls for invented stories impugning the character of their driver and housekeeper to provide some more employment opportunities for the Kims, this time for the deadbeat dad Ki-taek and his wife Chung-sook. Bong said that \"Sometimes with the characters in my films, I look at them cynically, but most of the time I have a lot of compassion for the characters, even with the villains.\" This compassion, however, does not seem to extend to the loyal, hardworking household workers, their work scammed out of existence. Without going into detail, the whole escapade backfires in a twist that is over-the-top unsettling even though utterly implausible.Worthy of a Mack Sennett comedy, a sweet family drama turns into a tumultuous melange of hidden chambers, revenge, bloody violence, a torrential rainstorm, people hiding under beds, and any other mayhem that may come to mind. To be clear, Parasite can be very funny and some of the satire is sharp-edged, yet it is hardly, as one critic described it, \"a masterful dissection of social inequality.\" When asked what he wanted viewers to get out of the film, Bong said, \"I just hope that it gives audiences a lot to think about. It is in parts funny, frightening, and sad, and if it makes viewers feel like sharing a drink and talking over all the ideas they had while watching it, I'll wish for nothing more.\" Enjoy the drink. In a little while, you may have trouble remembering what the film was about."

If I have one and only one advice to give you: go savor this fabulous movie with a strict minimum of information! Indeed, this film might schematically be split in two parts, the second one being quite surprising and unpredictable. The script is excellent and the casting is globally sumptuous, especially the gorgeous Cho Yeo-jeong for whom I may confess I have a crush.As a postscript, an anecdote certainly insignificant but literally astonishing when you're French: in the middle of the film, the proletarian family gives itself up to an orgy, the coffee table being covered with manifold dishes including two French cheeses as industrial as cheap: \u00ab Le rustique \u00bb and \u00ab Bresse bleu \u00bb.

            "Review": "So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, \"I'm in no mood for trouble\", to the final \"hey!\" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (\"Sometimes just once is enough\", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, \"periwinkle blue\"). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, \"Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary\".f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.\nIn conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative."

            "Review": "...from the first time I saw it at age 14 until today whenever I run across it.This is the rare example of a much-ballyhooed film that is truly deserving of all the hype surrounding it. It would have been nice to have experienced the film without any knowledge of the plot twists. Unfortunately, for most viewers, the big surprises are not possible since so many of the scenes are part of our popular culture.There were, however, so many unexpected surprises. The opening scene with Janet Leigh and John Gavin in the hotel room was amazing and (pardon the clich\u00e9) so real. Hitchcock and Janet Leigh did a brilliant job of pulling us into Marion Crane's story, that of a woman in love with a divorced man who might as well be married considering his heavy financial obligations that leave him unable to marry in a practical sense even though he can in a legal sense. He doesn't even have a proper home - just a room in the back of the store he owns. Marion is then seemingly set up as the center of the movie as she thinks she has found a solution to her problems - a felonious one. Then the focus is skillfully shifted to the Norman Bates character as the \"protagonist\" victimized by his insane mother (or so it seemed) and then the focus is shifted once again to Marion's sister's search. The movie was adapted from a novel so some of the original audience would have been familiar with the plot of the book. In the novel, Norman Bates was a middle-aged man. I think it was a brilliant stroke to have the Norman of the film as a man in his twenties, a boy who never grew up in a man's body. Anthony Perkins is so identified today with his role of Norman Bates that it was surprising to see how endearingly he played him in the early scenes. And he did one of the best stammers I've ever seen in a movie when he was being questioned by the private detective (Martin Balsam) who is also searching for Marion. I also wasn't expecting to see how protective the local sheriff and his wife were of Norman when they were being questioned about him and his mother. You could tell they didn't want somebody (Norman) whom they thought had been dealt a bad hand to have anymore publicity and scrutiny than he already had.This film is mentioned in the documentary \"Moguls and Movie Stars\" as an example of how films were becoming more like TV as the 60s began - spartan art design and a script that was bold in the amount of sex and violence it had, even if the vast majority is implied. You have to be impressed by the versatility that is Hitchcock. Making movies in England? No problem. Making movies in the American studio system? No problem. Modernizing to deal with the evaporation of the production code? Again, no problem. Weird factoid - for you TCM fans out there Robert Osborne is credited as \"man\" in Psycho, although I don't remember him ever mentioning it. The only person it could possibly be unless he never comes close to having his face on camera is the parson as the sheriff and his wife are exiting church. See what you think."

            "Review": "When I watched this for the first time in over 30 years, I was surprised how little action there was since I had remembered this as some intense horror movie. Of course, I was young and more impressionable so I guess I just remembered those few dramatic, sensational scenes such as Janet Leigh murdered in the shower and the quick other murder at the top of the stairs. Basically, that was about it, action-wise, BUT I have no complaints because the more I watch this film, the more I like it. It has become my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie, along with Rear Window.I mention the lack of action, and blood, too, because younger people who might be watching this for the first time are not going to see the kind of horror film they're accustomed to seeing. A generation back, movie makers tended to build up characters and suspense, so there was a lot more storytelling and less action than you see today. Also, this movie doesn't have the shock value today for audiences, either, not after years of Freddie Krueger-type blood-and-guts seen in the past 30 years.But, what you WILL see in this movie is (1) superb acting; (2) a fascinating lead character; (3) excellent photography, and (4) a bizarre story.\"Norman Bates\" is one of the most famous fictional names in film history, thanks to this film and the great work portraying him by Anthony Perkins. \"Norman\" is a nutcase, as it turns out and the more you know all about him, the more fun it is to study Perkins and his character \"Norman\" in subsequent viewings. He really has the guy down pat. However, it isn't just Perkins' film; the supporting is just fine with Leigh, whose figure is still awesome no matter how many times you see it; Martin Balsam as the private detective; Vera Miles and John Gavin. Everyone contributes.What makes me really enjoy this movie is the cinematography. I bought this on VHS when it became available on widescreen. Later, of course, I got the DVD. Each time, I appreciate John Russell's camera-work and Hitchcock's direction more and more. I wonder if this isn't Hitchcock's best job of directing as his camera angles and lighting are outstanding. On the DVD, the blacks, whites and grays are just super and the famous house next to the Bates Motel never looked better. That house really looks eerie.The sound effects in here don't hurt. When Balsam is attacked, the accompanying frightening music never fails to bring chills down my spine. The music literally \"screams\" at you.I went 35 years between showings but now have watched this five times in the past four years. I love it and look forward to seeing it again. Many people here think this is Hitchcock's greatest film. Add me to that list."

            "Review": "What can you say about a film that's been talked about to death? Just this: If you've never seen it, you owe it to yourself to do so, not because it's a way of paying homage to the one true master of modern film, but because it's so fun to watch.Janet Leigh plays a bored office drone who decides to steal some loot from her boss's obnoxious client and parlay it into a new life with her all-too-distant boyfriend. All is going more or less according to plan until she stops in at the wrong motel, where she befriends a friendly if somewhat nerdy desk clerk only to find it causes problems with that clerk's possessive mother, who as her boy explains, \"is not herself today.\" I'll say she isn't, and so would Leigh's Marion Crane, who maybe should have put up that \"Do-Not-Disturb\" sign before taking a shower.You can feel the decade literally shifting out of '50s and into '60s with this one. Even the opening shot, where the camera looks over a Western U.S. city in the middle of the afternoon and zooms in on what looks exactly like the Texas School Book Depository overlooking Dealey Plaza. Norman Rockwell touches abound, like the decor of the motel, but look at what's going on around it. People dress well, they still wear fedoras and jackets, but in their tense conversations and hooded gazes you can feel the culture just ticking away like a time bomb waiting to explode.Most especially, there's Anthony Perkins, who plays motel clerk Norman Bates in a very oddly naturalistic way, complete with facial tics and half-swallowed words, not the polished image one expected to see then. Just compare him with John Gavin, who plays Marion's boyfriend in the standard-actor-of-the-day way. Perkins manages to be so weirdly magnetizing, even in small moments like the way he stumbles on the word \"falsity\" or notes how creepy he finds dampness to be.He shines in bigger scenes, too, like his tense chat with Martin Balsam's boorish but diligent private detective character, Arbogast, who along with Perkins and Leigh delivers a landmark performance. The way both actors play out the awkwardness in their conversation makes you literally sweat. Then again, you're always uneasy around Norman. You definitely feel wary of him right away, but you find yourself liking him, too, even when he's busy covering up \"Mother's\" misdeeds. Not since Bela Legosi played Dracula did you get a horror movie with such a compelling central figure.If you are sampling the many other comments here, be sure to look up Merwyn Grote's. He makes an interesting, compelling case for how director Alfred Hitchcock used his television series as a template for \"Psycho.\" Certainly \"Psycho\" looks more like early 1960s television than any of the more sumptuous fare Hitchcock had been bringing to screen at the time. Not only is it in black-and-white, not color, but the sets; a ramshackle motel, a mothbally old house, a couple of cheap looking bedrooms, a bathroom in a used-car dealership, are deliberately low class.It's thrilling to see Hitchcock move so effectively outside his normal element, and move things along with such clinical detachment and low-key technical finesse. Thrilling, too, to realize this is one of his most accomplished products; made by a man who was experienced enough to know how the game was played, and daring enough still to break the rules; indeed, start a whole new ballgame.Is it the best Hitchcock movie? It's definitely one of his best, right up there with \"The 39 Steps\" and \"Strangers On A Train\" and \"Sabotage\" and \"Shadow Of A Doubt.\" He only once again came close to making as good a film, with \"The Birds,\" while Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins never escaped the greatness they helped create here. Poor John Gavin had to quit the biz entirely, and became an ambassador.Often imitated, parodied, referenced, and analyzed to death, \"Psycho\" still isn't played out nearly 45 years after it came out. You owe it to yourself to pay a visit to the Bates Motel; Norman has a room ready."

Hitchcock truly was the master of suspense, but he proves he could do horror to, Psycho is the perfect fusion of Horror and Suspense.What audiences in 1960 must have thought when they say down to watch this for the first time, when you think what had come before, this film truly was a game changer.Pacing is sensational, it doesn't hold up for a second, the suspense element is tremendous, first time viewers are in for several shocks, when the big moments come, they are hammered home.There are several sensational scenes, but that shower sequence, that rates as one of the greatest movie moments of all time.Anthony Perkins delivers a performance which is nothing short of remarkable, he's so soft and gentle initially, but the switch up, is incredible. Why he wasn't Oscar nominated is beyond me.The music, as big a character as Norman Bates himself, even on the opening sequences it's powerful and alarming, but the score that accompanies the killings, talk about hairs standing up on the back of the neck.One of my top ten greatest film of all time.10/10."

            "Review": "Robert Bloch wrote the original work, Joseph Stefano adapted it into a tight screenplay but it was Alfred Hitchcock with the extraordinary complicity of Bernard Herrmann who transformed this lurid tale into a classic, horror masterpiece. The score propels us into the moment before the moment arrives provoking the sort of anticipation that verges on the unbearable. The fact that the key scenes have become iconic film moments: copied, imitated, emulated and parodied, have not diminished its impact, not really. The anticipation, underlined by Herrmann's strings, creates a sort of craving for the moment to arrive. That doesn't happen very often. No amount of planning can produce it or re-produce it - otherwise how do you explain the Gus Van Sant version - so, the only possible explanation is an accident, a miraculous film accident and those do happen. Everything falls into place so perfectly that even the things that one may argue are below the smart standard of the film, are needed, the film without every frame is not quite the film. Try to turn away after the climax during Simon Oakland's long explanation. You can't. I couldn't. Partly because you know you'll soon be confronting those eyes, that fly, the car..."

            "Review": "Getting into Hitchcock's Psycho, 57 years after its original release is like assisting to a masterclass of sorts. We can now identify what made this little lurid tale into a classic. Hitchcock himself, naturally, but now we know the first director's cut was a major disappointment and that Alma Reville - Hitch's wife - took over, re edited and the results have been praised, applauded and studied ever since. Janet Leigh's Marion Crane created a movie landmark with her shower scene. Bernard Herrmann and his strings created an extra character that we recognize as soon as it reappears under any disguise but, what shook me the most now in 2017 is Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. His performance has evolved with the passing of time and its effect has remain as chilling, as moving, as funny and as real as it was in 1960. It's interesting to watch Gus Van Sant's 1998 version with Vince Vaugh as Norman Bates. If you look at the film, shot by shot with Berrnard Herrmann's strings - it's pretty fantastic. - Play it in black and white if you can. The problem and it is a monumental problem, we wait for Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, if the casting of Anne Heche was really bad - not a hint of Janet Leigh's humanity, the casting of Vince Vaughn was incomprehensible. Not just not credible for a moment but annoying, very annoying. Anthony Perkins brought something profoundly personal to Norman Bates and as a consequence we connected with his sickness. We felt for him. Okay, sorry, I didn't mean to go there but I felt compelled to because I saw again Psycho (1960) ad Psycho (1998) at 24 hours from each other and realized that the main flaw of the 1998 versions is the absence of Anthony Perkins."

            "Review": "I am a huge fan of Hitchcock, and have really liked all of the movies of his I have seen so far. My top 5 favourites are Vertigo, North By Northwest, Rear Window, Rebecca and this masterpiece. Before I saw this, I considered Vertigo as his masterpiece. After seeing this movie, I think Psycho outshines Vertigo.Psycho is a film that you see once and never forget, and one of the few movies out there that has left me traumatised. The infamous shower scene is without doubt one of the most terrifying murder scenes in any film. When I first saw that scene on the 100 Greatest American Films, I was so terrified and I admit it I have never recovered. I had a similar experience watching the Disney film Sleeping Beauty with Maleficent enticing Aurora to the spinning wheel, and Mrs Gulch turning into the Wicked Witch in the Wizard of Oz.The shower scene isn't the only effective or chilling scene in the film- in the events leading up to that scene I was biting my nails. The scene with the old woman in the chair also made me jump out of my skin. The whole of Psycho is terrifying, suspenseful and shocking. Two elements made this so. One was Hitchock's direction. The great director proves how truly great he is by directing Psycho in a masterful way, and manages to deliver the shocks when needed. The other is Bernard Hermann's music. What a creepy score! I loved his score for Vertigo and Miklos Rozsa's for Spellbound, but the high violin motif in the shower scene is the main reason why that scene in particular is so effective. I admit it, when I hear that motif, I start screaming. There is just something about it that makes your blood run cold.Other pros are a good plot, a well constructed screenplay and beautiful black and white cinematography that is perfect in conveying the creepy mood. And the ending did surprise me. The acting though was exemplary, with Janet Leigh giving one of the deservedly most memorable female performances in a Hitchcock movie, and Vera Miles also giving a stellar performance. Stealing the film is Antony Perkins as Norman Bates, he didn't just play creepy, he WAS creepy, his face, his voice, his mannerisms.. in short it is one of the most chilling performances of all time. All in all, a Hitchcock masterpiece! 10/10 Bethany Cox"

            "Review": "Alfred Hitchock is the master of suspense and Psycho is probably his most famous film. Because, let's face it, one way or another, you have seen or heard of this film. It's been made fun of, been remade(unfortunately), not to mention that this movie's word will be spred from generation to generation. I came across it very young, my parents used to tell me how scary it was and how I wouldn't want to take a shower after watching this film. I didn't believe them, but when I watched it, I for the first time pulled the blanket over my head, it was that frightening! The thing that is so amazing about Psycho is how much of an impact it made, and understandably why it did. It ranked in over 60 million dollars at the box office, now this was the time where tickets were like 50 cents at the theater, now if you compare that to today, that's Titanic like money! It broke many taboo's, like this was the first film to show a toilet being flushed, isn't that interesting? My high school teacher said that her and her mom saw Psycho when it was first released in theaters and she actually ran out of the theater terrified! Alfred did so well keeping us glued to our seats with all his great twists! This was before The Sixth Sense, I mean, the ending is just such a mind blower! But I won't give spoilers.Janet Leigh plays Marion Crane, a woman who is in love with a divorced man Sam Loomis. He says once he pays his ex wife off with the alimony, they'll get married. When Marion's boss asks her to put their most valued client's money, $40,000 to be exact, and bring it to the bank. She has other plans though, she takes the money for herself and flee's the city, but not before her boss sees her driving off. Shaky enough, huh? But she pulls over to get a nap in, and a police officer asks if she's OK, but she gets shaky and just wants to drive off. The policemen fallows her since she is so shaky and she ends up buying a different car. She gets caught in a giant rainstorm and pulls over to the Bates Motel.She meets there, the owner, a pleasant and polite young man, Norman Bates. He lives in the house next to the motel with his mother. Marion checks in and Norman offers her dinner, they have a conversation mostly about his mom and Marion is concerned when she heard screams from the house that sounded like his mom. Norman gets on the defenses and asks Marion some questions as well, she says she is going to a \"private island\". Norman is very attracted to her, you can tell immediately, and she leaves knowing that she has to get out of the trap she set for herself back in Phoenix. As she's taking a shower before bed, a mysterious figure comes to the curtain and opens it stabbing Marion violently several times causing her to die. Norman cleans up the mess and gets rid of her body not knowing about her money and throwing that away too.Marion's boyfriend, Sam and her sister, Lola, hire a private detective to find her. The private detective comes across The Bates Motel and doesn't end up coming back after trying to \"talk\" to the mother. Lola and Sam are concerned and decide to investigate for themselves, but will they end up coming back to the city alive? Psycho is just one of those movies you have to see before you die. It's one of the most important films of our time and will never be forgotten. It's a true treasure with terrific actors and a terrifying plot that will give you nightmares for weeks! Please don't let that scare you, I'm just having fun, but it is a freaky film! Watch it in the dark! It has a better effect, I think. Over 40 years and this film is still horrifying as if it were made today! 10/10"

            "Review": "This famous film with known story tells about Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) , she works in a Phoenix (Arizona) office, when his employer trusts her some money . Seeing the opportunity to take the cash and beginning a new life along with her fianc\u00e9 Sam (John Gavin) . Larcenous Marion leaves Phoenix and heads with her car towards California where her lover with debts is owner a store . When is caught in a storm and pursued by a policeman , she leaves the highway and enters Bates hotel . The hotel with twelve rooms (and 12 showers) is managed by a strange young (Anthony Perkins) who seems to be submitted by his overbearing mother , she's living at a creaky mansion nearly hotel. Then, rare things start to happen . Later on , a detective named Arbogast (Martin Balsam) , her sister (Vera Miles) and Sam (John Gavin) are looking for Marion , asking for help a stubborn sheriff (John McIntire).\u00a8Psycho\u00a8 was not only Hitchcock's biggest successful movie , but was a phenomenon in its own right . The picture is a magnum opus in the terror genre and its immediate impact and its future influence was enormous and cannot be over emphasised . It's the quinta-essential shocker that created an authentic sub-genre about psycho-killers and continuing until nowadays . The shower image is one of the most studied , copied and analysed sequences in cinema history and has obtained a notoriety what exceeds of the movie itself . Terrific performance by Anthony Perkins in an immortal role as Norman Bates and sensational Janet Leigh with Oscar nomination included that was the only one in her long career. Inventive and superbly constructed plot , filled with delicious black humor by writer Joseph Stefano based on Robert Bloch's novel. The highlight of the film is , of course , the shower scene , it was made with 70 cameras to shot the 45 seconds of footage and the creepy sound effects were realized by stabbing a knife into a melon . Magnificent credit titles by Saul Bass , he's usual on Hitchcock films .Excellent black and white cinematography by cameraman John Russell , as Hitch thought it would be very gory in colour . Bernard Herrmann's legendary musical score copied and endlessly imitated , aids to create a thrilling atmosphere . Film is directed with exquisite taste and intelligence by master Hitchcock who makes an impeccable control of every scene and maneuvers your emotions , infusing with a deliciously macabre wit , it makes \u00a8Psycho\u00a8 far superior to the several movies what tried duplicate , or imitate it ; these are the following ones : \u00a8Psycho II\u00a8 (1983) by Richard Franklin , \u00a8Psycho III\u00a8 (1986) by Anthony Perkins himself and for cable television : \u00a8Psycho IV\u00a8 (1990) by Mick Garris. Hitchcock's Psycho belongs to his best period in the 5os and 60s when he produced his finest works , perfecting the art of suspense in a series of masterpieces : \u00a8Dial M\u00a8, \u00a8Rear window\u00a8, \u00a8Vertigo\u00a8, \u00a8North by Nortwest\u00a8, \u00a8Birds\u00a8 and specially \u00a8Psycho\u00a8 , all of them are still studied and copied today . Rating : Indispensable and essential classic movie."

            "Review": "When Hitchcock tells a tale, he engages the mind of the audience. We don't need to see knives tearing into flesh, people being strangled on the screen, or gunshots ripping through a brain. And still, when we are finished, we are more uncomfortable than had we watched the actual murder. In Psycho, it's all about vulnerability. Janet Leigh is in a state of great agitation and needs to trust someone. Unfortunately it is the master taxidermist, Anthony Perkins. His Norman Bates, with his nervous tics, his analytical surmises, his understatement, are master-pieces of madness. This film is what every student should see. It is montage; it is tautness; it is the best kind of storytelling. The things which were still with me a month after seeing this for the first time were as follows:1. The house. That ominous house, peering down, Poe-like from the hill above the motel. How can architecture better capture threat.2. The scene with the patrolman.3. The conversation Norman when Marion first stops at the motel.4. The shower scene. I can still hear the theramin (used again at the end), and the blood flowing down the shower drain.5. The killing of Martin Balsam on the stairs (he also used this perspective in Vertigo and Topaz).6. The \"conversations\" with Mother.7. The naked light bulb swinging as the rocker turns around and Norman coming into the basement.What a great director. He saw everything and knew how to fill every minute with suspense. A truly masterly film."

            "Review": "Most modern-day horror films make the killer to be an absolutely inhuman, grotesque, unimaginable monster in order to scare the audience out of its wits.  Most of the time, however, these stereotypes create a generic murderer a raving, ranting, clearly demented psychopath.  One of the few memorable cinematic killers that does not adhere to these restraints and cliches is, of course, Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter, whom manages to effectively cause the audience to recoil without such drek as the aforementioned devices.Anthony Perkins' skillfully crafts his performance as Norman Bates, avoiding a ranting, raving, drooling, murder-happy, manic characterization; instead his performance as Norman is subtle, creepy, cool, and unsettling.  He is brilliant; from his quiet conversations with Marion Crane amidst the stuffed birds, to his weasling wimpiness when confronted by Arbogast, his performance is so exact that it chills the viewer, all without the unnecessary disturbing images prevalent in more modern films (read The Cell, Henry: Portrait of A Serial Killer).Perkin's fine performance, a tight script, and Bernstein's classic score make Psycho a film that is now and will always be remembered as one of the pinnacles of the horror genre."

            "Review": "When Psycho came out, the horror industry of movies was merely monsters, zombies, werewolves, and vampires. So when Psycho hit screens, the audience was finally introduced to psychological thrillers. It hit with such a huge bang that the audience was shocked...with fear and suspense. Psycho created what the thriller genre is today. It sliced through clique monster movies and changed it forever. Still today when you look at Norman Bates and his extremely freaky look when you see him watching the inspector's car sinking into the swamp sends chills down my spine. And when Marion Crane met her bloody demise in the middle of the movie, Hitchcock proved to everyone that this movie is different, different from every other movie you have ever seen. The cinematography in this movie is fabulous, the music is marvelously freaky, the acting is magnificent, the story is exceptional, and everything else about the movie is great. Too bad the sequels and the new remake was complete trash."

            "Review": "This is one of the best movies ever created and Alfred Hitchcock is one of the most intriguing film makers ever to live. (in my opinion) There's just so much to say about this film I hardly know where to start.I first saw this movie about five years ago and wasn't impressed at all. Of course, I was about ten years old at the time. I didn't think that the famous shower scene was anything to frightening and the characters seemed a little boring. A little less than a year ago, I became very interested in the history of the film and not so much of the film itself. I read articles, reviews, anything that I could get my hands on. Then, Psycho was shown on AMC and I immediately thought that it was a masterpiece. Shame on me for not appreciating it sooner.The film as a whole is spectacular, but I like to break it down into little sections. First, I was very surprised and impressed with the actors that played Marion Crane and Norman Bates. Janet Leigh isn't given to much exposure to the film since she is killed off in about the middle of it. I thought that she did a good but not great job. On the other hand, Anthony Perkins blew me away. Both Norman and Anthony are very interesting. Norman's life that is set up and shown to us is so well depicted that I can't imagine anybody else playing the part. All of the characters including Arbogast, Lila, and Sam are so well created. Obviously, the plot is so unique and odd that you can't help but smile at it. A young woman on the run after stealing $40,000, and then accidentally falls into the wrong hands of a psychopath. It's great! The best thing is that nobody has ever done anything quite like it, and they won't be able to because then the magic will be gone. Even though the ever so famous shower scene is said to be one of the most chilling death scenes in history, I think that it may be a little overrated. I love it as much as the next person, but it's not all that scary. Who said it was supposed to be scary? Nobody, I know. But the majority of the Psycho audience gathers it to be very frightening. I do still think that it is one of the greatest and shocking scenes ever. The setting is very well set up as well. The Bates motel and house is so cleverly created that it brings a special atmosphere to the audience. It has something about it that you just can't forget.Finally, that music played throughout the film is one of the most spookiest sounds I have ever heard. Great job to the music composers and to Hitchcock for this scary addition to the movie. I think it's safe to say that everybody has heard of Psycho, but not everyone has seen it. For those of you who still haven't seen this amazing flick, go see it! It's a must see."

However, it's hard for me to imagine anyone other than Perkins playing Norman Bates with complete authenticity, it's seems the role was simply made for him and only him.  Could you possibly imagine anyone other than Nicholson in the role of Randall P. McMurphy in \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\" or Dennis Hopper as Billy in \"Easy Rider\"?  Keep in mind the introverted, insecure Mama's Boy was not really PSYCHOpathic as Hannibal The Cannibal was in \"Silence of the Lambs\" - a cold-blooded killer with no conscience - but rather criminally insane, plagued by schizophrenic delusions and seriously in need of multiple reality-checks.  Anthony Hopkins did a wonderful job as the vicious Hannibal, and also as Corky, the schizo-killer ventriloquist in \"Magic\".  I think he just might have pulled off a convincing Norman, but don't believe he was available back then.  Oh well, so much for speculation...Perkins did a great job."

            "Review": "PSYCHO truly is an excellent film, a movie which, along with the same year's PEEPING TOM, managed to kick start a new genre of psychological thrillers which continues to this day. It's perfectly made, with an excellent story (thanks to the reliable schlockmeister Robert Bloch), a great script adaptation, and assured direction from Hitchcock.It's hard to know what stands out here the most: the brooding cinematography, in which features such as the Bates Motel become characters in their own right, or Anthony Perkins's most famous role. Perkins encapsulates Bates perfectly, making him a bogeyman far more frightening than the OTT fantasy creations of a Freddy Krueger or Jason Vorhees.Watching it today, it's tough to imagine sitting through it without knowing the various twists beforehand, but they must have been mind-blowing to newcomers. And one of the things I like best is that the film is already great, and thrilling, even before the action shifts to the Bates Motel. Add in a great Martin Balsam performance and you have one of the greatest masterworks of 20th century cinema, in my humble opinion."

            "Review": "No matter how many times one sits through this Hitchcock classic, Anthony Perkins always manages to surprise you. It is a sensational performance - for which he didn't even get an Oscar nomination - I have no way of knowing how much preparation he dedicated to the creation of Norman Bates, maybe no more than usual, but the details of his performance are astonishing. Never a false move and if you follow the film looking into his eyes, you'll be amazed as I was. The madness and the tenderness, the danger and the cravings. A mamma's boy with hellish implications and yet we see, we feel connected to the human being, we are not horrified by him but of his circumstances. In short, we kind of understand him. That alone puts him miles and miles away from other cinematic monsters. From Richard Attenborough as the real life Christie in \"10 Rillington Place\" to the hideous, unredeemable Christian Bale in \"American Psycho\". Here Hitchcock and Herrman create an universe that Anthony Perkins inhabits with the same kind of electricity, nerve and shyness that Norman Bates projects throughout the film. Janet Leigh falls for it if not him. She, like us, sees the boy trying to escape his dutiful son's trap. He is in my list of the 10 most riveting characters ever to be captured on film."

            "Review": "(((((SPOILERS))))For most people, the most memorable scene in Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO, indeed it's most famous scene, is the shower sequence. It has been broken down and analyzed ad nauseam as an example of the fine art of editing. It is a great sequence, but to me the best scene in PSYCHO occurs just before that. Janet Leigh as Marion Crane, on the run from having committed a crime, sits in the parlor behind the Bates Motel's office and discusses nothing and everything with Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, the motel's lonely proprietor. It is a chat between strangers who desperately need to talk to someone, anyone, but have no one to whom they can confide. It is a beautifully written and acted scene, which serves as the calm before the storm. For all of its flashiness and sleight-of-hand gore, the shower sequence isn't nearly as effective at showing what a master filmmaker Hitchcock was. It is in the parlor scene that the entire narrative spins around; as the audience is prompted to switch their allegiance from Marion to Norman. Nothing really happens in the scene, other than two characters talking, but how things are said reveals as much as what is actually said. Here Marion comes to terms with her mistake and decides to pull herself out of her \"private trap.\" Norman introduces us, indirectly, to Mother and wins our sympathy, which is vital to the way the rest of the film plays out. The scene very skillfully sets the mood of uneasiness that propels us into the upcoming murder, even as it suggests that Marion is achieving a sense of inner peace. Madness is revealed, danger is suggested, yet the audiences is coolly and cruelly lulled into an almost tranquil state. It is obvious something is coming, but not so soon. Then the shower curtain is ripped aside and blood begins to splatter.The measure of a film like PSYCHO is not how cleverly it fools you the first time, but how irrelevant its surprises are to enjoying it time after time. Indeed, compare it to Gus Van Sant's 1998 remake, or even Brian De Palma's 1980 semi-remake, DRESSED TO KILL, and the power of the film is obvious. Van Sant's version, though a scene for scene imitation is barely watchable even once, especially if you are already familiar with the plot; and while De Palma's homage is stylish and intriguing the first time around, its psychology and plot tricks don't stand up on repeated viewings. By contrast, Hitchcock's PSYCHO can be viewed repeatedly with full awareness and appreciation of knowing what is coming up next. I think an element of Hitchcock's genius is apparent in that he doesn't treat his major plot twist as a just a gimmick. The entire first half of PSYCHO could have been treated as just a shaggy dog story, a prelude marking time until Norman Bates' story takes center stage. But Hitchcock realized that Janet Leigh's story had to be presented with all due gravity, otherwise the shift to Anthony Perkins' story wouldn't be nearly as effective. Neither Van Sant nor De Palma seemed to understand this, especially De Palma who treats the Angie Dickinson scenes in DRESSED with a cruel, condescending sense of humor. Hitchcock's PSYCHO works as a whole, but could very easily have been presented as two independent episodes of \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents.....\" Marion Crane's story is not just a build up (though Hitchcock himself claimed that killing off his leading lady was all meant as a joke on the audience), but as a complete story unto itself, replete with the type of shocking twist ending that was the hallmark of Hitchcock's television anthology. Likewise, the Norman Bates half of PSYCHO, is a complete suspense tale in its own right. The shower scene is the bridge between the two stories, but it is the scene in the parlor that cements the two tales -- and the fates of the two protagonist. And if you look at PSYCHO as two separate parts of a whole, then Marion's story is revealed to be the more complete of the two. Norman's story, while beautifully done, is essentially a mystery story; Sam, Lila and Arbogast are trying to solve a whodunit: what happened to Marion and the $40,000? The cleverness of Hitchcock and screenwriter Joseph Stefano is that they let us think we know the answer right off the bat, building to a conclusion where it is revealed how completely we have been fooled. In the end, we know little more than Lila and Sam. To some extent, this is the real gimmick of the film. On the other hand, Marion's story allows Hitchcock to make so much out of so little. He creates tension, even though there is no tangible threat. Marion is on the run with stolen funds, but the theft hasn't even been discovered yet. All of the danger is strictly in her mind: What will happen when...? She is a smart woman who has done something very stupid, but proceeds even as her fears grow and grow. But cinematically the suspense is created out of mundane things: a policeman's face at the car window, rain and windshield wipers slashing across the screen, the glare of on coming headlights. Mix this with the haunting voice overs of accusing voices and Bernard Herrmann incredible musical violence and the effect is hypnotic. But these imagined dangers do not prepare Marian or the audience for the real dangers ahead.And something has to be said for Janet Leigh. Always overshadowed by Anthony Perkins' iconic performance, Leigh never gets her due (though she was nominated for an Oscar, she lost to Shirley Jones in ELMER GANTRY). But she dominates the first half of the film with a vivid performance that is sexual, humorous and bittersweet. So much of her role depends on the subtlety of her facial expressions: her sad smile at pretending to believe Sam's excuses for not marrying her, her bemused glances at the flirtatious old millionaire, her self-satisfied smirks as she thinks about how people will react to discovering her crime, her mixture of concern and fear as she talks to Norman in the backroom parlor. Plus, she displays an attitude that is both smart and sexy. It is one of the great film performance.It's easy to take PSYCHO for granted now; it has been imitated so many times in so many ways by far lesser talents. Indeed, it's one negative is that it inspired so may pale imitations, including its own three sequels and a very bad remake. Yet even so, PSYCHO remains a one and only original. And its iconic status can't be denied; it redefined the concepts of what a Hitchcock film was and what a horror film could be."

            "Review": "\"Psycho\", the Hitchcock masterpiece of 1960, is still a scary ride. TCM presented it on Halloween night, which was an appropriate way to add to all the horror being shown on television.As the film opens, we are treated to Saul Bass' titles that herald some of what one is expecting will come in the film. Then, one hears the magnificent opening bars of Bernard Herrmann's music score and one realizes this is not an ordinary movie. The crisp black and white cinematography by John Russell, as well as the intelligent editing by George Tomasini, surpass any doubt this was one of Alfred Hitchcock's best work. Of course, the film owes a debt to Joseph Stefano who adapted the Robert Bloch novel, in which the movie is based, with great flair.\"Psycho\" works because of the wonderful cast assembled for the movie. Anthony Perkins was an actor who could play anything. His range was enormous, as he shows in the film. His Norman Bates shows a man that appears to be in complete control of himself. We watch him as he begins to unravel when confronted first by Arbogast, and then by Sam Loomis. Mr. Perkins' performance is one of the best he ever gave in his film career.Janet Leigh who plays Marion Crane is perfect as the small would be criminal who happens to be in the wrong place, at the wrong time. It's a tribute to Ms. Leigh's talent that she underplays Marion because she is battling with her own conscience as she realizes the enormity of what she has done. Alas, she was not going to make good on her resolve.The supporting cast is also interesting. Martin Balsam plays the private detective well. He is instrumental in cracking Norman's confidence, but of course, it comes with a high price he must pay for trying to shake the sick man. Vera Miles and John Gavin are seen as Marion's sister and boyfriend.\"Psycho\" will remain an exercise in horror by a man who knew how to scare us, Alfred Hitchcock!"

            "Review": "The movie started out pretty innocently, and for the first 20 minutes, I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you'll be dead.Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldn't be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he'll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.I still think that Oskar Shindler's last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - \"Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people.\""

The realisation here is chilling.The film's pacing is quite remarkable, it's a three hour film that flashes by quickly, but it's three hours that will live with you forever, some of the scenes will rightly never be forgotten.What has always struck me, is the way that everything became normalised, people first losing their businesses, their homes, their freedom, and ultimately their lives, it is truly one of the bleakest points in human history, that's what this film details perfectly.The Cinematography is incredible, it's understated, but perfect, fits the film perfectly, the sheer scale of it is so impressive. The scene with the little girl in the red coat has always been one of the standout moments.No wonder it won a string of Oscars, the acting is outstanding throughout, I have always regarded this is Liam Neeson's best ever performance, but Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are remarkable also.It's a film that informs, moves, and makes you think in equal measures. If you think it's going to be too much, I'd say this, it is very upsetting at times, but it does also give some real glimpses of hope, the remarkable human spirit.A jaw dropping, powerful movie, it's one of the best ever made.10/10."

Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust, but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler's List did. Schindler's List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and Schindler's List did that to me. If you want to see the best depiction of the Holocaust, make your way towards Schindler's List.\nMe n my kids cried during the pit scene."

I don't imagine any better casting for any character. They all chosen well. With Liam Neeson's Schindler, Ben Kingsley's Stern and the great villain Ralp Fiennes' Amon Goth.Scores is the soul of the movie. John Williams mades you feel that.Cinematography is too great, watching this movie with these colors makes the movie too much realistic. I don't know how is it doing that. I know some of the movies are trying that when flashback scenes are coming, but most of them are not being successful at.Art Direction and Set Decoration is also too varied. They managed to do an enormous job. You feel the greatness in the movie with varied places and objects."

            "Review": "History has proved that the old saying, \"God makes mad first whom he intends to destroy\", and in the case of Nazi Ralph Fiennes in this Steven Spielberg masterpiece, that is oh, so true. Unfortunately, a lot of innocent people have to pay for that madness in the meanwhile, and that truly adds to the intensity of his madness as it increases and his vileness just gets more and more out of control.On the other end of the spectrum is Liam Neeson's Oscar Schindler, a businessman who knows by allowing the Nazis to take his Jewish workers away, his productivity will suffer. Selfish motives keep these innocent people from being sent to the death camps, and as Schindler learns the truth about the atrocities going on and becomes closer to the people who work very hard for him, he goes out of his way to keep the Nazis from going through with their evil plans.The atrocities you see here are things we can't fathom here in America. Innocent children are forced to hide in human waste to avoid discovery. An innocent woman prisoner with a background in architecture is brutally murdered after insisting that a building being constructed is doomed to collapse, after which the evil Fiennes simply orders his men to do what she suggested. Fiennes picks targets and guns them down, and also has Schindler's aged workers killed simply because he considers them too old to contribute. An innocent young girl in a red coat (the only color in this black and white movie) wanders around Warsaw as the ghetto is destroyed. Neeson almost looses his right-hand man (a magnificent Ben Kingsley) because of a paperwork mix-up. This culminates in the most daring of escapes from Nazi persecution, and that is where Neeson realizes the full effect of what's going on, breaking down in a scene that will have you shivering in your seat.I can't watch these movies without the temptation to scream at the Nazis on screen. Even in the most outlandish propaganda films of the war era, I tended to either applaud loudly or scream in delight \"Die, Nazi, Die!\" as the villain gets their come-uppance, either through brutal murder or the firing squad after a lengthy trial revealed their shame. Many of those times, my body was shaking so violently as sobs emerged from me that I was unaware I was capable of. You can't call these feelings manipulation by the direction; Spielberg obviously felt a passion for the story he was telling, as if he knows that this can cross over into any race, any culture, any religion.Rarely in recent movie history has it been so obvious when a film was released that it would sweep the Academy Awards, and \"Schindler's List\" truly deserved every honor which it received. Some stories are so painful that you can't go back and watch them easily; I find that every so often, I need a movie like \"Schindler's List\" to remind me of how vile humanity can be, and how one compassionate human being can change the course of history for so many. The finale with real-life \"Schindler Jews\" honoring their hero is truly awe inspiring and is certainly what you can call triumph over tragedy."

            "Review": "Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a social climbing opportunistic womanizing German businessman. He charms important Nazis, and gets access to limitless Jewish labor. He gets Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) as his right hand man, and Jewish money to pay for his business. He provides the front. Using black market deals and advantageous connections, he becomes rich and powerful. Stern works tirelessly to save people. Even as the Jews are rounded up to Plaszow labor camp under the command of unstable Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), Schindler is able to befriend the mad commander.This is probably the most important movie of director Steven Spielberg's career. At least it's the most important for him. Based on the true story, Spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create this iconic movie. The black and white provides starkness and thankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are the perfect duo. Ralph Fiennes gives a complex performance as the mad commander. The shock of the horrors of the Holocaust is expertly done. When I first saw it in the theater, I couldn't help sob a little when Schindler breaks down at the end."

            "Review": "We need to look at a work of art like this to see ourselves in this movie. This is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of the human being. It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country."

            "Review": "Some of Schindler's List is very disturbing indeed, with very graphic images on the screen. I thought this film is outstanding. True, it is very long, but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi's treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox."

            "Review": "Probably the most powerful and important film one can watch in this or any lifetime. The Nazi atrocity is presented in stark images of horror beyond comprehension and even the power of one's own imagination. The scene that brought that all home to me was the one in which the young Jewish boy made his way down into the latrine to escape the nightmare of separation from his family, only to find others had beaten him to it. Such desperation, such will to survival.Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are superb in their respective roles. The filming in black and white is only appropriate for an era of history devoid of color. Amon Goeth (Fiennes) crystallizes the Nazi sentiment toward an entire race with one line to Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) - \"I realize that you're not a person in the strictest sense of the word\".\"Schindler's List\" is hardly the type of film one can consider a favorite, it's reach goes far beyond entertainment. It deserves it's recognition as one of the best films of all time, it's power resides in giving literal interpretation to the message 'never again'."

            "Review": "SCHINDLERS LIST is Jewel.Evil and indifference we see all around us every day. And there are times when goodness is as rare as lamplight in a howling storm \u2013 Michael Wilmington 93'The brutal realism of WWII, countless crimes against humanity and the darkest journey imaginable is breathed into life in this epic adaptation based on the true story of Oskar Schindler. Directed by renowned veteran director Steven Spielberg this story of morbid ethnic cleansing, is of timeless learning for generations to come. Starring Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, Ben Kinglsey as Itzhak Stern & Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth there isn't a moment of distraction from the matters at hand. Oskar Schindler an industrialist and an obvious opportunist acquires an enamelware factory in Krakow employing Jews from concentration camps in the region. Hounding prisoners to invest in his industrial venture as he reaps the financial benefits, whilst the Jewish investors are paid their returns in metal ware. As the war comes with the Germany losing, the SS begins moving its prisoners Westward to remaining camps. Oskar Schindler invests heavily on Jewish workforce by bribing the SS for his own interest. As time passes his interests were in-tuned with the well being of his workforce than himself strident towards bankruptcy.Performances that are brutally surreal and engrossing will break you down, whilst certain artistry of hand held cinematography will place you in the midst of all chaos and tragedy. Shot in black and white with certain exceptions of the odd girl in the red coat for personification, the realism of the morbid drama of the holocaust will never leave the audiences' mind. Up until 1993 Spielberg although is renowned for his creativity behind the camera certainly has not dealt with a screen play with such delicate baggage. A slip of the slightest would have this historical drama crawling, gaping for life at the mercy of its 195 minutes of runtime. Never is it so. With CGI at its minimal and the concentration on the subject, and the subjects' woe within the subject is where Spielbergs' heart is at. Enigmatic is where I am left as the end credits roll up embracing me with its moving score.What took me so long to watch this? Is something I keep asking my self now. Profound Beauty! If you appreciate art, this is a masterpiece.TITLE: SCHINDLERS LIST DIRECTED BY: STEVEN SPIELBERG STARRING: LIAM NEESON, BEN KINGSLEY & RALPH FIENNES RATED:R RATING: 09/10 RUNTIME: 195 Minutes"

            "Review": "Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List tells what the holocaust was really like from the perspective of the Jewish people when they got sent into the concentration camps until a man named Oskar Schindler saves them from the concentration camps. Schindler is played by Liam Neeson who gives the best performance of his career as a true real life hero for the German people even though he was a member of the Nazi party in real life. What Spielberg tries to prove with this movie is that he is not only capable of making swashbuckling epics like Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Science fiction classics like E.T, Minority Report, Close Encounter of the Third Kind, or Hitchcockian thrillers like Jaws, but what he did with this movie is that he set a new movie genre to his movie-making vocabulary that got Oscar buzz as soon as it came out into theaters and was a total smash at the box office. Also not only Liam Neeson gives the best performance of his career, but so does Ralph Fiennes who plays a Nazi soldier named Amon Goeth a soldier who five no mercy at all. In order for Schindler to save the Jews from getting persecuted what he does is that the talks to his accountant named Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) into making a list of the names of the 1200 Jewish people that he has to save. This was a remarkable movie that will stay in my memory for as long as i live and what a masterpiece Spielberg has created."

            "Review": "The Holocaust is a dark and touchy subject for many. Many believed it never happened, despite meticulous records kept by the Nazis themselves. Those who lived through it were scarred forever, and even now can barely bring themselves to discuss its horrors. Despite the controversy around the event, there is one thing for certain, Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece with Schindler's List. It is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak, crushing drama. It sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself.The film is in black and white, a very conscious choice by the director that makes the subject matter, already disturbing, even more so bleak and harrowing. Oskar Schindler is known for saving thousands of Jews destined for a grim fate during World War 2. The movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal, with constant brutal oppression by Nazi camp guards and the sadistic Amon Goth, with a terrifying portrayal by Ralph Fiennes.Yes, this film will not make you cheery or happy. Yes it is about a miserable and dark period in human history, but it is an important film to watch for anyone interested in this historic subject matter and also a beautiful work of art for film lovers. Truly one of Spielberg's finest works. The fact that he is Jewish himself does add a personal touch to the tragic tale, but he never tries to overdo the sympathy or antipathy towards any group in the film.Everyone is human in this film, the Jews and the Nazis; the tragedy is that humanity itself failed during this period of history, and we will never forget."

            "Review": "'Schindler's List' is one of the most important, illuminating, admirable, and beautiful films ever made. It is also one of the most enigmatic, unnerving, and demoralizing ones ever made. This makes for a most interesting combination. What this translated into for me was that it took me several viewings to finish the film, finding it necessary to pause to recollect my thoughts, both wishing to remember emotionally overwhelming scenes and to let myself realize that this is history. And quite recent history. As much as I wish this were another story of some fictional premise, I would be in denial, which is exactly what this film aims to alter. Because of these very reasons, Holocaust films are usually not very successful. 'Schindler's List' remains as a preeminent exception to this. I was amazed to learn that Steven Spielberg was behind this masterpiece. Apparently, among other great directors, Scorsese & Polanski were also given the opportunity. And I am damn glad it was Spielberg who ended up with it. But I have to admit I would not have said this before seeing what he can do; apparently the variety of his talents. The same man who brought us the Indiana Jones & Jurassic Park series. Where is the Hollywood action? The pizazz? The overdone glamour? Even his more serious films, Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can, Munich, seem to be done by a completely different director. To me, they all pale in comparison to this film, which I confidently assert as the quintessential Holocaust/Nazi film. Spielberg's choice to film in black & white illustrated the foresight and vision of a master. Furthermore, his selection of what minimal color would be used (bookend scenes & the young girl's red coat) was pure genius. It gives the film a timeless quality, yet matching the feel and style of the time of the events, rather than the time of filming. Whether or not intended, the film also drew parallels to Italian Neorealism, traditionally filmed on location, with some unprofessional actors, telling the stories of struggle and everyday life. The girl's red coat was a conspicuous way to make a visually beautiful statement. Our eyes are drawn to this unexpected, sparse, vivid infusion of color. \"Look at me,\" it says. \"You can try to be in denial, but this is really happening. You cannot pretend it isn't These deaths, this injustice, this wrong is not going away on its own.\" And, in fact, it is when Schindler realizes that the girl he observed so silently only days before is now gone forever, signaled only by her red coat, that he sees this and begins his dramatic character shift. The second use of color, in the bookends, seems to be primarily for the candles. Both scenes portray a family observing The Shabbat. In the opening bookend, before the start of the war, we watch two votive candles melt away into nothing; in a beautiful use of cinematography, the last of the smoke from the candles, lightly colored, dissolves and transforms into the black and white smoke from a train arriving in Krakow, Poland. A title card announces World War II. In the closing bookend, to signify redemption and the renewal of hope, these same candles are relit; color is renewed."

The black and white was genius, and how he had the little girl in red and the fire was phenuminal. I have never seen anything like it, Schindler's List is beyond all words."

            "Review": "The first time I've seen it, Schindler's list didn't give me much of an impression. It was horrific, black and white, and I was 15. Now, after I got myself quite a cinematographic culture, feeling the urge to identify Spieblerg's masterpiece, I came back to this movie. I knew it was rated as one of the best films generally, ever, but when I took a look at the reviews, I became really worried. Most of the 1/10 ratings bring reasonless motivations for this film's criticism. The main points of criticism that I saw are the following: 1) it manipulates facts; 2) presents a too distinct line between good jews and evil Nazis; 3) too emotional; 4) money grab; 5) \"Holocaust is bad, we already knew it\" (and this is an almost exact quote);1) the claims for this point of criticism are that it portrays a positive figure of Oskar Schindler, exaggerates several aspects of the holocaust, and portrays essentially bad Nazis (we to this latter point in 2)); Let's get this straight: unlike some reviewers claim, Oskar Schindler didn't end up as an enriched Industrialist, as some reviewers wrongly claim. In other words, he didn't earn off the holocaust anything. On the contrary, he spent his entire fortune on bribes and corruption acts in order to aid his Jewish workers. He even had to escape to Argentina, as many Nazi officers did after WWII. As for the claims of overly dramatisation, that is certainly an aspect of the film. There are a few scenes which are not accurate (e.g. the shower scene - in real life, jews didn't fear the gas chamber as they where purposely misinformed). Generally, though, I didn't see that much of an overly dramatization. Most of the times, the film presented simply factual events. Jews were in fact killed and persecuted, there's nothing overly dramatized. Concentration camps where truly such bloody places as seen in the film. Instead, maybe it even downgraded violence quite a lot., still being incredibly bloody as a film.2) Good jews vs. bad Nazis; I remember Hans Landa's monologue from the beginning of Inglorious Basterds, which centered on jews being rats in the sense that they're generally a population that could figure out a solution easily. Do not get me wrong here (obviously Landa stereotypes this immensely), but this is portrayed often, mainly in the first portion of the film. Jews going to the Synagogue to buy and sell instead of praying, some jews that join the police force and essentially collaborate with the Nazis, and some jews fight each other when hiding away during the ghetto persecution scene. I clearly would not say that all jews are good nor that all German soldiers are bad, but that shouldn't be a matter to be portrayed in a holocaust film. To see an avid jew, go watch \"A Christmas Carol\". As for \"bad Nazis\", I'd like to clear out again what is Nazional-Socialism. It was an extremist, right-wing movement that enhanced, in this case, Germany's national identity and superiority on the base of racial distinction, and urged violence on anyone that would not be member of the \"superior\" race. This movement, along with fascism, attracted a great deal of fanatics. I'd like to suggest the view of \"Novecento\", which similarly depicts the rise of fascism in Italy and its ruthless cruelty, carried on by it he insane and violent individuals which joined the party in the early twenties. I know that one movie depicted a Nazi soldier's moral division during WWII, called \"Onore e Lealt\u00e0\", which has low reviews for the same reason that prevents this film from portraying \"good\" Nazis: it is kind of dangerous, and can easily turn in a glorification of Nazis. Nonetheless, most of the cruelty is carried through a notorious war criminal, Amon Goeth. 3) Spielberg is of Jewish origins. As a filmmaker, he's considered this story very personal. Moreover, he is notorious for being emotional in his serious films. 4) It is well known that Spielberg chose to renounce for his fee as he considered it \"blood money\". Of course studios have to do a profit of their movies, but film is still a form of art. Movie makers of Spielberg's caliber do films without a simple capitalistic view of making money, but with the purpose of making an art work. Schindler's list is not a fancy action blockbuster, if nothing else, its black and white colouring identifies it as an art film. Add the fact the Spielberg felt personal about this story, and you'll realise how empty this claim is.5) This film was released in 1993; I personally don't know many outstanding holocaust films from before 1993 (certainly a lot from after 1993), or if there were, they certainly weren't as bold as this one. A black and white film about a crude subject that keeps the viewer's attention for 3 hours and 15 minutes. Think about it. I personally believe that, unlike other films (this includes my favourite holocaust film, Son of Saul), gives a such wide view on the holocaust. This film shows most of the aspects of the holocaust, some overrdramatised, but nonetheless represented. It is really stupid to see this movie as unnecessary. Conclusively, I'd like to point out that 6 million jews died due to the Holocaust. The only bigger genocide I know of is that of the native Americans, 18 million only in northen America. Seeing so many 1/10 reviews that base their claims on this being basically Jewish propaganda is worrying, especially considering the rise of right-wing ideologies that happened in the latter years. Are we forgetting history? I hope not. And, in case that's the truth, it's films like Schindler's list that remind us of that."

I really don't know how. \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" is fantastic! Deftly juggles deeply heartfelt character beats with crazy multiverse content, just packed with so many delightful easter eggs. Loved how Gwen's story is expanded, her scenes with Shea Whigham's Captain Stacy are truly special.Can't wait for the third one. Every frame of this movie is gorgeous! I didn't want to blink because I didn't want to miss anything. You can watch this film over & over & finds something new to enjoy. There are some surprises in this film that I truly wasn't expecting.\"Across the Spider-Verse\" is another milestone for animation. Yes it's gorgeous & visually mind-blowing, but this sequel surpasses the first for always putting Miles and his family front and center. The movie feels like a massive celebration for Spider-Man fans everywhere, whether you love the movies, games, comics, etc. But again, all the cameos and multiversal elements come second to both Miles and Gwen's story. Is a stunning achievement. Yes, it's visually dazzling, with expansive, expressive new realms The movie's real superpower is its emotional depth and its beautiful, melancholic tone.What more can I say...It's an actual work of art! Every frame deserves to be hung in a museum. The jokes and nods to Spidey lore are perfect. It's outstanding. \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" is yet another resounding win for the Lord Miller-produced universe. Hailee Steinfeld really comes into her own as Gwen Stacy. It's darker and sadder than I expected, but necessary."

            "Review": "The animation, flow of everything, genius character development, and action were all electrifying! This is one of the best Spider-Man adaptions deserving of the high ratings entirely. I love all the portals connecting to other dimensions and Spot is such a fun villain. Shemeik Moore, Hailee Steinfield, Jake Johnson, and Oscar Issac among everyone else was superb so much talent this movie better be nominated for best animated feature like the previous one was years back deserving of its win! For a movie that's fairly long it stayed entertaining from start to finish and keeps you wanting more, I loved it all so much.Also since this review is doing well I have autism and would love any opportunity to be more known in the world! My real name is Alex Nolan and I crave movies a lot since I was quite young. I wish I could work on movies and spend time with famous people."

            "Review": "If it wasn't already obvious in the first film, it's now officially clear as day that the people behind the Spider-Verse franchise (including writers/producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller, who are absolute creative godsends to the once magnificent place known as Hollywood) understand EXACTLY what they're working with.Don't let the marketing fool you: this film has GUTS. It's easily one of the heaviest PG-rated films I've ever seen. Payoffs and character revelations that were only hinted at in the first film are carefully, deliberately unraveled and come around beautifully. It made me think about my own life and what I mean to the people I care about in ways I never expected. The fan-service is BATTY too, and yet somehow it's never too much.I wish every movie was as good as this---but then again if the world was like that this wouldn't feel as special. So I'll just stick to being IMMENSELY grateful that it exists in this universe.This is no ordinary sequel. It's art of the highest form."

            "Review": "This film is a visual concert. The animation and character design neatly put me to tears. The opening of the film took an approach that shocked me, but it was fantastic to watch. Many of the jokes were in the trailers, but plenty caught me off guard in the cinema. Miguel even had a couple of funny moments. The presence of existing spider characters, such as snippets of the other films, did feel somewhat strange I have to admit. However, it is made up for in how incredible this film was. It was artistic, mature, adult, and profound. It leaves the viewer on a cliffhanger that shocked me. I thought I was an hour into the film, but it was the end. I implore everyone wondering if they should see this film to do so. Easily the best film I have seen in a long time and the best film to see in theaters. A true masterpiece."

            "Review": "First off, you should know that this is the first part of one big movie split into two, Harry Potter style. Except, everyone in the theater went nuts when it ended, I guess because it doesn't have \"Part One\" in the title. It doesn't really stand on its own, as far as the story goes. So it's kind of hard to rate it, since it set up way more than it concluded. Can't wait to see the next one.Anyway, even as just one half of a two-parter, this movie is awesome. If you thought you liked the style of \"Into the Spider-Verse\", then you got another thing coming. This movie is so much more than that, it's crazy, and it does not disappoint. Boggles the mind how this much stuff can even be animated at all.The visuals have got to be seen to be believed. Every scene has so much going on, and you could even say each scene has its own art style. It goes way beyond what the first movie did, and that was already crazy. The blending of styles on its own makes this a one of a kind movie, that will be hard to replicate. I'm even sort of mad that this creative energy hadn't been released before, because we are getting some insane stuff nowadays.One small complaint I do have is that all this, combined with the very fast action can make it a bit hard to breathe sometimes. Honestly I can't take too many points off for that though.The soudtrack is great, I can't wait for it to release. There truly are some bangers in there, and most of them are actually the score of the movie, not licensed music.And the story is awesome as well, although again it's hard to judge before seeing the next one. There's a lot more going on than in the first one, and most This movie explores the character of Gwen more and it's awesome. It's still about Miles though, and that part is also cool. I loved the Spot.So yeah I could say more, but I think you should just go see it. This might end up as one of the best trilogies of all time."

On one hand, the action scenes are spectacular, and the animation is, once again, amazing. On the other hand, this movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes long and it feels like it. Plus, the visuals can be so kinetic that the film becomes busy & chaotic. This sequel offers some real drama, however it's not a complete story, and it ends on a cliffhanger. I think my rating will solidify when I watch Beyond the Spider-Verse and see how it all ends."

            "Review": "It's been some time since I've walked out from a cinema feeling as satisfied by a film as this!I enjoyed Into The Spider-verse, in my humble opinion, this went one better, my anticipation for the next installment has definitely gone up a few notches.The best element for me, the visuals, I'd argue this was a labour of love by the team behind it, it looks sublime, the action sequences are seamless, one to the next, jaw dropping.Pacing is terrific, visit the loo or go for a drink at your peril, you may just miss something.I think this is a film that fans of Spider Man, any fans, new or old will enjoy, its appeal is so broad.I'm not a die hard Spidey fan, so some of it went over my head, but I am reliably informed by my fellow cinema goers that there were plenty of Easter eggs to hunt, lots of references to all forms of Spider Man.Shameik Moore did a first rate job, as did Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen, her character development was a key element.I assume this will win many awards, it deserves to, that good I'm going again!!!Nailed it!! 10/10."

Around the 2 hour mark I started wondering when or if there would be a climax? Various scenes felt like they were dragging on for way too long. We really didn't need all the scenes of Peter B. Parker and his child. For me personally I felt like there was no build up or anticipation due to how long certain scenes played out. Then the film ended on a cliffhanger and then I understood, this film is a middle movie, a gateway between the first film and the next film and unfortunately it showed. They didn't have a definitive ending for this film which is fine but at some point the scenes just felt like filler. I believe it is still a movie worth seeing, however, it falls short of the first movie in terms of keeping my attention."

            "Review": "I absolutely loved 2018's \"Into the Spider-Verse\". It not only earned its \"Best Animated Picture\" Oscar, not only was it the best Spider-Man movie, but it stands as a landmark in animation. It set the record for most animators working on a single film. That record was then broken by this sequel. With five years of anticipation, and with the talented hands of Lord and Miller behind the scenes I was super hyped for this movie. I was prepped to love this film. I had heard nothing but good things, and all its praise is well deserved. But I couldn't help but walk away just saying the film was...good.Given the film's stellar reception, I feel compelled to explain why I only am giving this film a respectable 7. First off, this film is not a complete story. It is a \"part 1\" and ends on a \"To Be Continued...\". I don't think that's a spoiler considering the original teaser advertised it as \"Across the Spider-Verse: Part 1\". But like the great cliff hangers of the past, like \"Two Towers\", \"Empire Strikes Back\" or \"Back to the Future part 2\", the movie needs to complete some self-contained conflict. This film does not complete a conflict. There is no feeling of resolution. I feel my full review is currently being held hostage from the fact that the story is incomplete. I can't give this full marks considering the story could end like the series \"Lost\" and completely undermined the whole journey.With that out of the way, I can tell you all the things that makes this movie great. The animation is a step up even from the previous groundbreaking entry. There are so many different animation styles that the team juggles, and it they all looked visually stunning. For some it may be over stimulation, but I thought it moved at just the right speed.The \"fan service\", \"Easter Eggs\" or whatever you want to call them, are never overused. There are some movies that treat the Easter Eggs like they are the main course, this movie balances them well. They never overstay their welcome and always add to the story as opposed to distract from it.The humor is spot on. There are so many jokes in this movie that had me laughing awkwardly loud. The jokes don't have the typical MCU problem of detracting from a serious moment, those are given the time to breath. But the jokes are fast paced, witty and come from a variety of sources. There are visual gags, character jokes, situational jokes and it isn't all reliant on a single person for their humor.And the action in this movie, it is next level stuff. Every fight scene or chase scene is like the bridge fight in \"Kung Fu Panda\". The movement is fluid, the detail is superb, and everything falls in just the right place. It is poetry in motion, since they are Spider-Men doing the action, all the acrobatics and reflexes work well within the story. It is a reminder of what makes this character so much fun to write for.There are 2 main conflicts that pop up in the story, both feeding into the same narrative theme. When the second comes into focus, that is where the movie loses some momentum. It is nice for story reasons in that our hero feels completely alone. The problem is it raises a lot of questions that might get answered in later movies, but for now are ignored. On the positive side, just when I think I have the film figured out, it throws one last hook at me, and absolutely has me hooked for the next one.Who knows, maybe one day when the trilogy is completed, I will come back and amend my review. But as it stands right now, I can't give it anything higher than what I gave it. Don't let me down third movie, with great power, comes great responsibility."

            "Review": "\"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" currently has an astounding overall rating of 9.0. Like many other incredibly high ranked movies, I'm sure over time the score will drop but given it's so high now, I cannot imagine it leveling off below 8.0...meaning it's one of the best rated movies of all time. Well, while it might be a great crowd-pleaser, I am writing a dissenting review....and if you are like me, you might not be as bowled over as most reviewers.To put things in perspective, I am 59 years-old and certainly NOT in the target audience....so keep this in mind. While I like an occasional superhero film, I also don't adore them...but I did think the previous Spider-Man film, \"Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse\" was one of the best of its genre. In fact, I gave it a 10...I was that impressed with its originality and story and animation. So why was I left colder by its sequel? Well, there are several reasons. First, if you are like me and not all that familiar with Spider-Man, you'll probably find much of the story confusing...unlike the previous film. Second, the artwork, while very original, made my brain hurt! It was LOUD and BRASH and really awful...at least to me. The worst part was that the backgrounds actually looked like I was watching a 3-D movie WITHOUT 3-D glasses! Uggh...it was an assault on my eyes. And, third, I hated how the film ended with no plot resolution whatsoever....none.So does all this mean I hated the film? No. I laughed quite a few times...and mostly when it introduced other alternate universe Spider-creatures (many are women or animals...not just Spider-MEN). I also thought the basic story, once you strip away the horribly fast edits and garish artwork, was very interesting. Overall, not a bad film but I just did not particularly enjoy it nor do I particularly need to see the third and final film in the series."

The fact that this is a cliffhanger and it ends very abruptly makes it feel like it's both overly long and incomplete. There is so much going on in this film and so many new characters introduced and just as the plot finally starts to pick up and get good they end it on the cliffhanger. I don't understand how people are giving this movie such a high score but complaining so much about Fast X doing the same thing. This film is not complete and for that reason I felt like it wasn't as enjoyable as it could've been."

            "Review": "LIKES:The Pace For The Most Part\n-Comic book movies are an art that requires balance to tell all it has to tell, and Miles' next story.. has A LOT to tell.-It found a good pace for me to tell the story, giving you the character development, but not at a pace that was too slow and lost on itself, for the most part.-Yet, the movie did manage to keep it slow enough that there was real development, build up, hints, and appreciation to age like fine wine.-This dynamic was very impressive to me, keeping an engaging movie for my attention, but not skimping out on the action like some of these deeper movies try to do.-That takes talent in the cooking pot as big as this, building on the past movie, but yet doing its own thing until the end for the setup.The Voice Acting\n-Everyone rocks in this movie, and I have to agree with my friend that it is grade A on many levels with what you get in live action movies.-Isaac is still strong as the anti-hero role that he often plays. His moodiness, his anger, his dark edge are mirrored in the character. There is hurt, anguish, and the fire that he shows so well, and I love how his voice is the main focus in his performance and not the looks.-Hailee Steinfeld is fantastic in Gwen. It's like taking all of her characters from her movie and integrating a piece of them into this Gwen and expanding her far into a character I really liked.-She was vulnerable and strong, a realistic character whose performance came out in spades and fully awakened the character I think they were going for.-And Moore... well Moore is just freaking amazing as Morales. That tone, vulnerability, this maturity but still immaturity cascading and once more evolving a character from the first one being believable. A stellar performance and one that I think brought so many things together, engaging with each of the others into this dynamic role.-It all works so well and I loved the strong talent bringing things to life.The Storytelling\n-There are so many who say that comic movies seldom tell a good story or are telling the same story over and over again. And to a degree... they are right.-Yet... for Across the Spider-Verse, that story feels fresh, engaging, and grounded to a degree that helps balance reality and super heroism into a great mashup.-It's not so in your face super adventures that are all about action, violence, and CGI madness, but it also isn't CW bologna about exploring our feelings in colorful underwear.-This sequel really focuses so much on building up characters, but integrating it into this main comic adventure that works to keep both involved and feel like a superhero.-I love the heart into it, and the way they built up from the first movie, but yet made this movie its own thing, until the final moments where the known cliffhanger was going to come in.-And to add relative components to it, engaging characters, and keeping those characters involved in the story... that is tough work.The Comedy To A degree\n-I really enjoyed the diverse comedy in this movie, and how many types of jokes and styles that were in it.-Miles is sort of a jack of all trades, sarcasm, banter, slapstick, he has a little bit of everything in it and I love it.-Others are just rambling idiots who are throwing so many jokes and statements that some eventually hit, but you have to listen because they fluctuate in terms of volume and such.-And other jokes are so well-timed and loaded with sarcasm that you just appreciate the laugh from the time alone.-It has it all and in relative balance to keep things fresh and not overwhelmingly stale as they hope from one joke to the other.The Nostalgia and Easter Eggs\n-Part of that comedy comes in the references loaded into this movie almost as much as the plot in this movie, and it works.-Across the Spider-Verse, tackles many famous tropes in both Spiderman comics and movies, blending the two of them together into this natural flowing arc that utilizes it well.-Nostalgia reigns supreme in this movie, all the comic and show references of the webbed wonder just taking my child nature and taking it for the roller coaster ride of finding everything I could.-But the movie references as well... so much fun as well, seeing these micro moments and nods to the other universes and watching them blended into the comedy and story.-Then to have it just in the world, it's going to make for a fun rewatch potential in the future.The Action Scenes\n-A huge step up, Across the Spider-Verse took my dislike from the first film and unleashed much more of the action I knew it had.-The opening scene paints for some great things to come, but soon the fight scenes and adventure transform into something that is fun, exciting, and family friendly.-Chase scenes have energy, with styles that flow and show off the heart of the animation, feels of the comic book and fan art coming together into this cascade of color and energy.-I loved the way that they evolved past punches and added more emotions and stakes that though predictable still held glimmer of exciting twists if they come.-And the fact they can punch, kick, and slam without being bloody messes should please so many, alongside the fact that the action all goes in line with the actual plot.The Animation/Art Style\n-You've seen the trailers and the first one and know how beautiful the movie is. Amidst the blurry backgrounds, the movie really has bold art direction that captures comic book spirit.-The computer animation goes well with the natural feel of the art, and I loved the way it felt like flipping through a flip book and seeing it come to life.-It respects both worlds so well, and like the story keeps things easy to follow and discover to appreciate everything the Spider-Verse had to offer. That was epic.-And to keep all that in relatively stable camera work, something the first movie struggled with, shows how you can really continue to improve if you take the time and think things through.DISLIKES:The Comedy A Bit Too Forced\n-There are times where the humor is a bit forced for me, primarily in the moments where they just spout joke after joke after joke to the point where things get lost.-These moments are few and far between for me, but there are times where a character gets annoying over funny.Some Pacing Offsets\n-There are times where the movie trips up on the pace for me. A few moments where the conversations are dragged out or we get a tad touchy feeling and not enough of seeing what's going on.-This happened about the first hour or so for me, but once that part passes most of the movie establishes the pace I talked about for much of the movie.-At least until the need.The Ending 20 minutes for me\n-The ending 20 minutes felt very dragged out as it set up the cliffhanger we knew was coming the moment it said part 1 long ago.-The ending is very drawn out, you know the movie is over, and you know what is coming, but it uses the art to drag it out, bloating the movie for the twenty minutes that could have been in the next movie.-Fortunately one of the final moments adds that fantastic bridge with music, shots, and feels that work, but still... we could have cut a few things out.-And fortunately there are no end credits, which there does not need to be.The Sound Quality With Some Characters\n-It might have been my theater, but some of the characters mumble and talk fast meaning... it's hard to hear them.-Spider-Punk has some of the best lines, but they get drowned out by background noise, mumbling speakers, and sound inconsistencies.-This leads to missing several things and taking away from the character that seems so cool, and this happens to several other characters when there is so much noise. As such, those moments are annoying to me, but again could be theater dependents.The VERDICT:\nOverall, the praise is worthy to Across the Spider-Verse, and I was very happy with much of the film that they brought to life to this theater. It's a sequel that does things right, taking the first movie's foundations and bringing with it something to build up and enjoy to the full extent. That bold and beautiful art has been refined to near perfection, and does so much storytelling alone that it's almost enough to go see it just for that in theater. But the movie integrates story, morals, comedy, nostalgia, and action to a degree that really feels like some of the strongest storytelling in a superhero movie. I love the authentic feel of a superhero story, and I love the passion of balancing so much in a movie without every losing track of the story to tell. Sure there were pacing issues and some sound flops for me, but that's really minor when it comes to the movie overall and everything they did to make this movie the middle of the trilogy, but still stand on its own. You can obviously guess I'm recommending this for the theater, and yes families can see it as there aren't too much dark moments. And my scores for those who need it are:Animation/Action/Adventure: 9.0-9.5\nMovie Overall: 8.5."

            "Review": "I am absolutely lost for words. How the hell did they top the first one??? This is easily, without a shadow of a doubt, the film of the year. It perfectly balances humour and emotional beats on a razor thin blade. It's richly layered, complex and the attention to detail is absolutely incredible. The story is phenomenal, the characters are believable and have excellent levels of depth, the soundtrack is fantastic. My expectations were completely exceeded, I spent the entire 2h 30m runtime in awe. But one thing above all deserves very special praise :THE ARTWORK.This films aesthetic is jaw-dropping, I found myself plunged (for the second time now) straight into the pages of a comic book from my youth. The use of colour is remarkable, the animation is smoother than silk, the textures, the backgrounds, the lighting, the style itself - everything blends together perfectly to create one of the most visually stunning things ever committed to the screen. Almost any shot could be a painting, with inextricable layers upon layers of marvellous detail, hand-crafted by some extremely talented individuals. This is cinema.If this doesn't win the Oscar for best animated feature I'm rioting, and you'd better join me. GO AND SEE THIS FILM RIGHT NOW."

            "Review": "I was a huge fan of the first movie, excited for the sequel and pretty hopeful after I saw massive amount of RAVE reviews online claiming it to be better than the original. Well, that couldn't be further from the truth. The runtime was way too long and I FELT it from the beginning of the movie! (during Gwen's 20 minute opening.) By the time the film picked up its pace and stakes (the last 30 minutes) I was already mentally checking out, watching the time and waiting for it to end. And yes, basically nothing is resolved by the end of it, if you're wondering. Multiple people in my theater were groaning as the credits began rolling, due to the cliffhanger. Scenes stretched on far too long, had repetitive dialogue and just set up the final movie. I truly don't see the hype about this one. I think the wrap up next year will be good, I have seen films do a better job in a trilogy of making the second movie mean something. I feel harsh saying this, as the animation, soundtrack and characters are awesome! I just feel like people are acting like this is the best animated movie to be released, but it's just not. It doesn't live up to the greatness of it's predecessor. Hopefully the finale next year will make it all worth it!"

            "Review": "Takes itself way too seriously, and fails to tell a compelling story.The writers apparently tried to re-use the formula for the first Spider-Verse movie, at the expense of character growth.This movie has a cliff-hanger ending, meaning that it's really just half of a movie. It hurts the pacing.The action is very predictable, but at the same time, the story is unnecessarily complicated. There's never any fear that any of the main characters are in danger.Overall, it's missing the wholesome, lighthearted moments which were so endearing in the first movie. This is a good movie to skip in the theaters and catch on streaming/DVD."

And seeing all the other spider people including Spider-cat and Spider-rex . The spot traveling to venoms universe was absolutely hilarious. I hope to see ultimate Spider-Man from the video game I never finished on GameCube or Xbox for almost 17 years since I was a kid. Seeing 2018 Spider-Man from the PS4 game was very outstanding. I hope in Spider-Man beyond the spiderverse meets Tobey maguire and miles teams up with him and he helps him build the device and Gwen meets Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man and they help build the same device to bring miles home ."

This entire movie is gorgeous and keeps you hooked and almost forces you to continue watching, that's how amazing it is. The hype around this movie was 100% deserved and made sense, seeing as how this movie may be the greatest film I have ever seen.This isn't your run of the mill kids move, action movie, animated movie. It's a masterpiece that all ages can enjoy. An amazing sequel that sets extremely high hopes for the third movie."

            "Review": "Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is the first of a two part movie. These studios should be legally required to put \"part 1\" in the title. Fast X did the same thing and I felt unsatisfied when the movie abruptly ends with everything completely unresolved.Now Across the Spider-Verse endlessly better, but I still had that unsatisfied feeling when I realized I was watching the first half of a really long movie. So much is set up in the first act, including a cool villain, and is left completely unresolved.Think about your favorite movies. Now imagine that when you saw them for the first time, someone cut it off halfway through and made you wait a year for the rest. A movie needs to be able to stand on its own.Aside from that, I pretty much love this movie. I don't think it's as good as the original, but that's a high bar. The animation is incredible, especially during a long intro scene in a different universe. There are so many different styles and techniques. The characters are awesome, as are the ideas in this story.My only real issue is that the story felt a little messy and all over the place. But that made way more sense when I realized it was half of a movie. That's why we're still getting setup and introducing conflicts late in the movie. We'll have to wait and see how the second part pulls it all together. I also found the sound a little low during the action scenes and sometimes had trouble hearing the dialogue, even in Dolby Atmos.I already can't wait to see the next one. And if it does everything right, I can see myself raising the score for this one. I had a great time with Across the Spider-Verse. I also feel a bit unsatisfied.EDIT: On second viewing, I feel the same. It's awesome, but it's not complete. Instead of exciting escalation to a beastly climax, in the last half hour we get setup.(2 viewings, opening Thursday UltraScreen 6/1/2023, UltraScreen 6/7/2023)"

            "Review": "I generally liked the animation but it constantly reminded me of trying to watch a 3D movie without the 3D glasses. The petty drama is endless and becomes old fast. There are loads of action scenes that immediately devolve into slow soap opera drama. My wife and I kept nodding off during these whine-a-thones which seemed very contrived. I did like all of the iterations of spider flavors in the Spiderverse which were endlessly creative and entertaining. The music always suggests exciting action scenes but this becomes a little exhausting after the 4th or 5th wind up. Long winded exposition seems necessary to spoon feed a very lengthy and convoluted plot. When I booked I noticed the theater was sold out but we left before the end and noticed that only 10 members of the audience still remained having left before us. Spot was a good albeit comedic villain. I would suggest going just for the animation and humor even with the 140min run time."

            "Review": "I loved into the spiderverse, it had great animation, great characters, great plot development and great music. There is simply no way across the spiderverse is better. By the end of this it felt like they were dragging it out and I had lost interest quite some time previously. The animation is good but sometimes less is more, and there was less differentiation between the styles, I don't think bill sienkiewicz was involved in this one. I remember my emotions building in the first one, peaking when what's up danger kicked in in the soundtrack, but this got into some schlocky emotional teen drama territory that made me yawn. I also felt it was a bit cynical to split it in two, I'm sure the full story could have been told in one movie which would have upped the quality of the animation too. Then there was the sense of universal danger overload that this and other stories revert to to ramp up the drama; whether a universe or every parallel universe and it's uncle is at stake, who cares, trying to make it bigger than before doesn't increase drama, that comes from character and plot development, yeah, like it did in the first one. It needed more jokes too, nowhere near as funny as the last time."

            "Review": "Personally, I've never seen anything as original in an animated film as in this deeply mythical fairytale. What a surreal idea for a movie! It's hard to find an adequate description (because I also don't want to spoil this in the slightest way) but this film has a sense of \"otherness\" to it - for lack of a better word - like none I've ever seen. And the strange, mythical nature of this film - apart from the amazing artwork - is probably one of the main reasons for its appeal to me. Maybe the themes of the story don't feel quite as strange to an eastern audience because they fit to a certain degree with some eastern/Asian mythologies - to me, this beautiful piece of wonder was something new. And a profoundly moving experience. Outstanding animation; funny, weird, scary and touching at the same time, this unique work of art is one I can't recommend enough. 10 out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/"

The first half of the movie was very odd, which is one of the main reasons I kept watching as I wanted to understand it but that didn't really happen. Not enough was explained and it felt like a mix of random events yet there was an actual story. Im struggling to come up with a reason of why no-face was even in the movie, he was just there. This movie isn't bad by any means, it's just lacking somethings in my opinion. I also didn't. Really feel in touch with any of the characters as no room was left for them to develop. The wired and wacky characters made the film very unique and interesting, the film is visually beautiful as well, I would personally want more depth.It is a good movie with a lot of potential. 7/10"

            "Review": "This is a wonderfully imaginative and fantastical children's fantasy. It is easy to see why it was perhaps the critical hit of 2002. The film is glorious to look at. It is a testament to old fashioned animation techniques that seem to be resigned to foreign animations. Of course there is some use of computer imagery for certain shots but they blend seamlessly and the overall artistry involved is superlative.This is the first Hayao Miyazaki film I have seen and I will certainly watch his others. The story plays on many elements successful with kids films, that transport you back to your own childhood and also allows the young audience to connect with the themes in the movie too. The story centres around Chihiro, a young girl about to move into a new place and who feels insecure about the new environment she will be living in. These fears become a part of her encounter with a strange abandoned amusement park that she and her parents find when they reach a dead end in their car. At the park they find that their is a stall that is seemingly open, with glorious displays of mouth watering food. There are no people about but Chihiros parents decide to gorge themselves on this bounty and pay later. As Chihioro explores she comes across a strange boy who warns her to get out before dark. It is too late however, because as night falls, ghosts are awakened, and then by the time she gets back to her parents they are turned into pigs. She then finds that the route she came from is gone and she is now trapped in this place, her only allie being the boy she met earlier. She is told to get a job at the centre piece of the park, a bath house run by Yubaba, an evil power mad witch. This is a bath house for the spirits and Chihiro has to find a job there before she is found and turned into an animal herself, then unable to save her parents.The story is imaginative and the characters and animations endlessly unique and strange. This is just so much more creative than Hollywood. The characters are likeable and we become engrossed with Chihiros adventures inside this bathhouse, and the characters she comes into contact with as she tries to get her parents back as humans and whilst trying to get back to the human world. What I also loved in this film is that the animation gives it a real sense of cinematography, the drawing makes the film stand out in a way that American animations rarely do. Another film I think of that looked really good was Bellville Rendezvous. Another great point in fact the best part of it, is the fantastic score. It really is uplifting and very original. This is just great film making. *****"

            "Review": "I have seen many international films over the years and quite a few of these were Japanese. In addition, unlike many parents, I have seen a lot of anime that my kids have watched so at least I have some familiarity with the medium. Yet, with my background I still felt pretty confused and baffled by the strangeness of this movie. Now this isn't to say I didn't like it, but so many times I just couldn't understand exactly what was happening. Interestingly, when I saw the film again, I understood it much better and appreciated it much more. And this may be exactly how you might want to approach the film unless you already are a die-hard anime fan. See it, but be willing to see it without trying to think out the odd plot too much or even try seeing it several times. I know that each time I did, the film became more and more enjoyable and I began to notice so many cultural references. Now, several years after I first saw it in the theater, I have seen a lot more Japanese anime and films and it's practically second-nature to follow the film. So, for adults and those unfamiliar with the medium, this movie might take a bit of effort to fully enjoy, though with more and more children being familiar with and loving anime, it's very likely your kids will love it and will then be able to explain it to you!! As for the film, the animation is the best I have seen in any Miyazaki film, the story deep and fascinating and it's full of cute and endearing little touches that make the movie magical. See this with an open mind, please."

            "Review": "There is simply no denying that Miyazaki is the Godfather of Japanese Animation, time and time again delivering works of such incredible beauty, such stunning visual and sensory delights, such mastery of storytelling, that one can only be left speechless. Overwhelmed. Intoxicated with wonder. Such is the magic of Spirited Away.Much like Miyazaki's previous feature Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away is an epic fantasy that deserves no better medium than the stunning animation work of Studio Ghibli. This multiple award-winning masterpiece has grown to become the largest grossing film in Japanese history, and rightly so. From the moment our child heroine Chihiro enters the bath houses we are literally bombarded with an overwhelming sense of detail and rich, lavish colours rarely - if ever - seen in Western animation. Scenes such as Chihiro running through the field of flowers, the marvellous landscapes seen from the train, Haku and Chihiro soaring the skies above, and Chihiro running across the pipe to climb the walls of the bath house are nothing short of breathtaking, and undoubtably some of the most lavish animation ever to hit the screen.The world of Spirited Away is bustling with life; unique, quirky, instantly lovable creatures jostling about their daily activities and tasks in the bath houses, dancing across the screen like leaves caught in a playful summer breeze. The inventiveness of Miyazaki's character designs is wonderful to behold, in fact not since classic tales like Lewis Carroll's Alice In Wonderland and The Neverending Story have we been able to fall hopelessly in love with such original, quirky, magical, and fantastical characters. The viewer is plunged headfirst into another world for nearly two hours and one cannot help but be completely and utterly captivated.The music and original score is stunningly beautiful, the original Japanese language track of such high quality that one wonders why someone could insult the work by producing a dub track at all. With a plot differing in its complexity on so many levels, from the basic storyline to the omnipresent universal themes, to the riddling of Japanese history and fable throughout, children and adults alike will be mesmerised from start to end. A magical, awe-inspiring, tearful, laughter-filled, heartfelt journey through a land of sweeping fantasy and dreams. Prepare to be Spirited Away......"

            "Review": "Last year I saw Spirited Away on it's UK release. I've never been a particular fan of anime, and it didn't really occur to me that I was watching a foreign language film dubbed into English (or 'American'). I can't imagine seeing a live action foreign language film dubbed into another language, but hey, this is a kids cartoon, what does it matter? Up to a point it didn't, because I loved the film. I enjoyed it so much I set about digging up the Studio Ghibli/Miyazaki back catalogue, in the process Sprited Away was filed away as one of the lesser Ghibli's - still great, but compared to Laputa, Grave of the Fireflies and a few others, it seemed a little weak. BUT... I recently re-watched it on DVD with the subtitles and found the difference unbelievable. The film came alive like the other Miyazaki's I've seen. It seemed infinitely more layered, detailed, intelligent and witty than I remembered. Could it be that retaining the intended performances (even if the words are unintelligible) can make that much difference? Maybe the dub was just poorly done? Or was it just because I was now versed in the language of Ghibli? As a little experiment I decided to re-watch some of the film with both the English subtitles and English language dub in order to compare, I ended watching the whole thing out of morbid fascination. It's simply amazing what a difference there is. Entire scenes change. It's not just that subtle emphasis is shifted or the same points are made in a different manner - in the dub, the subject of whole conversations and scenes are changed, and often to some flat and uninteresting hokum. Relationships between characters are changed, their motivations and personalities are changed, the difference is shocking. I appreciate western, and particularly American audiences can be put off by subtitles. And cinemas are less likely to show the film anyway. It's pointless to be all righteous when, fundamentally, you just want people to see the film. Unless they do, this treasure trove will remain undiscovered, and maybe finding it will encourage people to conquer the 'subtitle demon' (as Miyazaki might call him). But the problem is the quality of these dubs, and the liberties taken with the source material. Of course, without speaking Japanese, who can say it's not the subtitles that are way off? They're probably written by westerners too. But the dub just stinks of Disneyfication. Saturday morning generic nonsense. The challenging, uncompromising and emotionally ambitious nature of the film is severely watered down.A fair question might be, 'if it's so bad why was it so successful?' The success is evidence of the films staggering quality. Even so, it hardly challenged whatever Jerry Bruckheimer movie was showing at the time. In Japan it's the biggest grossing film in history. 'Go figure,' as Chihiro wouldn't say."

            "Review": "Spirited Away contains a great cluster of creativity. The characters and ideas are mostly original and the core design which is the main character's (Chihiro) coming of age tale, completes with satisfaction. Yet the film feels familiar. It shares the same magic that Disney's older pieces contain and it is executed with a Japanese approach which does make it different but it has the same purpose. Which is to simply encourage younger audiences into being brave and so on.That cluster of creativity also becomes a bit mindless when random things keep happening, there is absolutely no consistency with anything. Details are introduced and have next to no meaning, other than expanding the lore. The mysteries that are wrapped up in the opening scenes unwrap cluttered and without defining details. Im not completely in the directors head and i feel as if some things just happened for the fun of it. I was expecting a layered story with the exceptionally high rating, with every detail having depth and meaning. Without spoiling the film, greed is frowned upon and im sure that capitalism is questioned, with the abandoned old themepark reflecting the loss of the old era. Little things such as Bo having to become small to become a bigger and better being, with him able to stand as a result are things to take away from the film.I do however, simply believe that the West has blown this movie above its true level. Yes it is original, yes it has qualities but apart from its unique characters 'Spirited Away' is not a special film for me. Perhaps i am being too critical or perhaps i am just disregarding the 2001 release date which may bring some exceptional credit to it, of which i am not aware. I have seen cartoon films before and i have seen anime's, yes this is a perfect combination of the 2 for children. I really enjoyed some of the characters but felt the story came short but perhaps i have set the bar too high in a film made for children. 8/10."

The twist in this film that Haku is really a river that saved Chihiro when she was a little girl comes out of absolutely nowhere and that is not a good plot twist\n.Chihiro gets extreme prejudice in the bath house because she is human but plenty of other characters appear to be human but get no hate?"

            "Review": "This movie is an outstanding piece of artwork. I hadn't heard much about it when it was first released. Being a huge Oscar fan, I was surprised when it took home the award for best animated film. At that point, knew nothing about it.After reading a little more and seeing some commercials, I still wasn't sure whether or not I wanted to see this film. It looked so surreal in an \"Alice in Wonderland\" sort of way. I had never been a big fan of that film and didn't really want to relive such an idea. Mindbending films have never been my absolute favorites.I went to see \"Spirited Away\" with a friend who was into anime. He hadn't heard much about it either, but was interested in seeing it in the theater. Since it had won the Academy Award, I decided it was a good idea to give it a shot.I am so glad I did. Only a very few times in my life have a I seen a movie as brilliant as this. It stands alone with such masterpieces like \"Citizen Kane,\" \"Vertigo,\" \"The Godfather\" and any other classic piece of cinema in history.I won't go into too much detail, but I was spellbound from the opening credits until the closing ones. The story starts out so rough and scary, but becomes a work of happiness and beauty. To think that this movie almost didn't get made is a travesty. It will stand the test of time and go out as one of the greatest films ever made."

            "Review": "That \"Spirited Away\" is a masterpiece would seem to any sane person to be beyond dispute. This is the first of Miyazaki's films I've seen and had it recommended to me by a friend who's into anime. I'm really not keen on Manga at all, so I delayed seeing \"Spirited Away\" for a few months. I finally got around to seeing the subtitled version - never, never waste your time with dubbed versions of foreign movies - over the weekend and I loved every frame of it. The imagination and creativity blew me away and I'd put the film alongside other \"children's\" masterpieces like \"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\", Philip Pullman's \"His Dark Materials\" trilogy and Ray Bradbury's poetic \"Something Wicked this Way Comes\"..However, in reading through the other comments for \"Spirited Away\" here I was struck by the huge chasm between the views of those who love the film and (the appropriately small minority of) those who don't.Even more striking is the strident hostility of those who don't like the film towards those who do. Critics here have called fans of the movie, \"liars to yourselves\", \"gushing\", \"flat-out wrong\" and the movie itself, \"inane\", \"unwatchable bilge\", \"muddled\", \"nonsensical\", \"gibberish\".Now I'd be scratching my head in puzzlement even if these commentators had blandly stated that this film wasn't for them, but this outpouring of venom had me completely perplexed.Another viewer states, \"The girl basically had to suffer for something even her parents didn't do wrong, they just wanted to explore things.\" And here lies a glimpse of some possible explanations of why some folks don't get this movie. The whole point is the parents *did* do something wrong. They greedily ate food that wasn't theirs. Apart from being just plain rude, it's stealing. As another commentator here pointed out, you have to look at \"Spirited Away\" against the context of the culture that produced it. The Japanese are very concerned about the erosion of their traditional values, the lack of respect kids have for their elders, the breakdown of family cohesion and other \"negative\" \"Western\" influences on their traditional, polite, family-oriented culture. Perhaps we in the West have trouble with the concepts in \"Spirited Away\" because the influences that the Japanese audiences fear are the Western \"values\" that are being thrust upon them, values that we've grown up with and forgotten how to fear.Another critic commented \"I cannot see why this film is such a masterpiece to some people ... (though) my brother and I had a few good laughs, especially when Sen runs down the stairs and smacks into the wall. That was pretty funny, I must say.\" This made me think back to when The Simpsons first started on TV - my daughter was three years old and she thought the funniest joke ever was when Maggie fell over. Now my daughter's a (very bright) 14 year old and these days it's the razor sharp satire of dysfunctional family life that makes her laugh out loud. QED. If someone isn't sensitive to the morals that are being examined in this film, then of course the film is going to seem pointless. However, as the film plainly does have more than one good point to make, perhaps it's just that these critics aren't capable of grasping any of them.But really guys (and you know who you are) don't take your frustration at not understanding \"Spirited Away\" out on those of us who do. It's not our fault you don't get it."

            "Review": "I love Studio Ghibli, and Spirited Away is one of my favourite films from the studio. This is coming from someone who was delighted by Howl's Moving Castle, blown away by Princess Mononoke, emotionally devastated by Grave of the Fireflies and touched by the simplicity of The Cat Returns all but to name a few. Spirited Away is a mystical, charming and truly enchanting animated fantasy, even with the long length and some slow moments. The animation is absolutely stunning, both the hand drawn visuals and the CGI graphics give an ethereal charm to the film. The characters move more than convincingly and the colours are beautiful. The music is also outstanding, I loved the simplicity of the piano and the drama of the more dramatic parts. The story is a pleasure, I know people have complained of some loose ends, but it is an original, touching and charming one I feel. I also loved the characters. Chihiro, voiced with real enthusiasm by Daveigh Chase, is sulky to begin with, but she is also brave and resourceful, traits I like in young heroines. Lin is kind and sympathetic, and Susan Egan who was also in Porco Rosso was unusually sensitive as the character. Jason Marsden is charming as Haku, and Suzanne Pleshette is perfect as the grotesque Yubaba and as her sister Zeniba. Overall, I loved Spirited Away, it is really charming. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

            "Review": "I've been hearing good things about this movie for years and finally decided to watch it, but I didn't quite understood it. There are things that I liked, like the expressive way the main character was drawn, the overall color palette and backgrounds, maybe some points for the original setting, but with that, I can't think of what else good to say. From all the things I've heard I expected the movie to be very emotional, yet I failed to notice such thing. I had seen the black character with the mask used in memes on the internet so much, that I expected he would play a really important part in the story, but in the end he was nothing special. The story really confused me, some elements didn't make much sense to me, and the ending was pretty rushed, like they ran out of money and had to complete the movie fast. I don't know, maybe I have to study Japanese philosophy and symbolism to understand what is happening. Don't get me wrong, I kinda enjoyed the movie, I just wish it made more sense. It sort of reminded me of the movie \"labyrinth\", but that movie has a very good structure and story, and you always know what is going on and why. In conclusion, I think the movie would be appreciated more by children."

            "Review": "Quite often I'll use the IMDb reviews and ratings to recommend a film, and that was the case here. With a ranking in the Top #50 as I write this I was anticipating something really special but was left somewhat disillusioned when it was all over. Probably the biggest disappointment for me was the lack of a coherent story line, or more specifically, the way the story veered off in completely different directions as if it was being written while the filming was already in progress. Story continuity seemed unimportant, one such example would be Master Haku's insistence with Chihiro that she must persist in getting a job from Kamajii the Boiler Man and refuse to take no for an answer. Failing to do so so would put her in jeopardy with Yubaba, but Kamajii simply recommends that Chihiro request a job from Yubaba directly, which she does.There's also the instance when Chihiro, now Sen, recognizes the bloody dragon serpent as Haku. How did she know that, and more importantly, how does the viewer come to that same conclusion, other than Sen's say so? There was enough of this kind of stuff to bother me in terms of effective story telling.I would surmise that Japanese anime is directed specifically at teenagers and young adults, and that's OK, just as it was back in the Fifties and Sixties with the explosion of monster films a la Mothra, Rodan and Godzilla. But to elevate \"Spirited Away\" to the level of masterpiece as some would suggest is carrying things a bit far to my mind. Perhaps in terms of technical achievement, one would have a point. The film is beautifully made and quite colorful, and some of the concepts seem original like the bathhouse for the spirits, but overall I was left unimpressed. Perhaps this is an acquired taste or maybe I'm too old to appreciate the genre, but this film didn't really do it for me. But you know what, I watched \"Grave of the Fireflies\" and I thought that was more thoughtful and insightful, so I'm not closed minded about the whole thing. I guess I'll have to try some other titles to see what works for me."

            "Review": "I'd class myself as a casual viewer, someone who's trying to broaden my horizon of movies, anime is perhaps not kryptonite, I can appreciate them, I don't often enjoy them.Spirited Away however, is one of the best animations I've ever seen, there's an incredible imagination behind this, a deep and complex story, mixed in with some tremendous visuals.I did have to read a few articles regarding the plot about forty minutes in, as I had a fair idea, vhr couldn't quite work out all that was going on, however as it developed it certainly opened up, the latter stages definitely seemed to make more sense, but if you struggle with the first twenty minutes or so, my advice is to stick with it.Best of all for me, the visuals, I thought this film even after two decades, looks absolutely incredible, it's a beautiful film. I thought the music was terrific too, totally in keeping with the spirit and vibe of the film.I watched this with English subbing, and the voiceover actors did a fine job. I was advised to watch it in its original format, but I was missing too much of the wonderful animation.Every time I watch an anime I seem to enjoy, this one was up a notch however, this is a film I've tried to encourage others to watch.8/10."

On the way to their new home, Chihiro's father makes a wrong turn and drives down a lonely one-lane road which dead-ends in front of a tunnel. Her parents decide to stop the car and explore the area. They go through the tunnel and find an abandoned amusement park on the other side, with its own little town. When her parents see a restaurant with great-smelling food but no staff, they decide to eat and pay later. However, Chihiro refuses to eat and decides to explore the theme park a bit more. She meets a boy named Haku who tells her that Chihiro and her parents are in danger, and they must leave immediately. She runs to the restaurant and finds that her parents have turned into pigs. In addition, the theme park turns out to be a town inhabited by demons, spirits, and evil gods. At the center of the town is a bathhouse where these creatures go to relax. The owner of the bathhouse is the evil witch Yubaba, who is intent on keeping all trespassers as captive workers, including Chihiro. Chihiro must rely on Haku to save her parents in hopes of returning to their world.I watched this film twice once when I was 11 and just recently on netflix and what can i say it was a ride of fun.The characters are likeable, the visuals were good too.Overall it is a good movie recommended to both kids and adults."

            "Review": "Actually I dislike his or her comments badly. If you didn't get it watch it again. This is not a piece to just entertain, the creator has put his own feeling and I believe life experience and the fear always buried in children's mind into it. It is a comely tale that express the creator's thoughts in some way, whilst shining as a attractive animation piece with so many details that you might have ignore if you were careless. It is a rich story and I can see the efforts creators put into it in many spots and frames.e.g. While Chihiro was walking towards the garden where Haku told her to meet him, she passed some stairs where she can see an island, there are some house on it, she stopped for it for a little while, that, represents her longing to human world, her own world, this kind of details can be ignored by many people but they don't mind putting it in to make the whole story richer, more truthful, full of power of humanity.Apart from that, did you ever notice that some \"camera language\" was used very well to tell the story in a more entertaining and better pace.e.g. When Kamaji was telling Chihiro how Haku turned up to this world before just like what she did, the \"camera\" panned to where the little rat(changed from the fat baby)was showing off to soots by putting his foot into the spell melted print while Kamaji's introduction about Haku's background is also getting across to the audience. This is just one of the details that shows how much story telling skills and rhythm control of plots.There're many other things like this, shouldn't be ignored if you want to make a nice comment, even though as an American viewer you might miss a lot of the story by lack of the culture background, but that's not the reason that you can comment it as anyway you want without even really READ the film.I am a visual effects person and film maker but I can't tell where the jerking of the footage and the stopping of character's movement are in the film. could Gazzer please enlighten us? As also a fan of Pixar I hope I don't have bias on either American animations or Japanese ones, but as a Chinese who might have some resistance towards Japanese products for national esteem or historic reason, I still admires Ghibli Studio's work. \"Spirited Away\" is a masterpiece of elegant picture and touching story, if Gazzer-2 knows what that means.\"Ice Age\" was a pretty cute one of Fox productions, but not good enough to compete with \"Spirited Away\" I'm afraid. And I'd laugh at the opinion that the story of \"Ice Age\" is much simpler hence Oscar committee didn't recognise it, actually I believe \"Spirited Away\" was beautifully hand-painted frame by frame while \"Ice Age\" had a giant crew in 3d animation and visual effects. I'm afraid Ice Age was the much more complicated one."

The scripts are totally banal and unnatural with nothing that makes me feel any emotion or humour. I find the dialogue boring and idiotic to be honest.Yes the animation is what must attract people mainly I guess but is it just me or is it no better than the weird cartoons I used to watch on kids TV in the 80s like Ulysees, City of Gold or Thundercats? I just would accept it as a kid in the 80s and it is not terrible but while quirky it is neither clever nor realistic nor beautiful. I am not impressed.The stories are mostly weird. In this case it is weird and unengaging for me. I cannot see why people rate it so highly. The characters are drab and cold or sullen and the script is nothing to get me interested at all. The kookiness is all that I can see to attract people. I feel it appeals to the kind of computer game playing, does not leave their bedroom type of geek who has not grown up. It is neither for children nor for adults which is my main disconnect I think. Just my opinion."

            "Review": "As the rest of the Western world was amazed by the throngs of CGI animation, and the inside Disney jokes, Japanese audiences were given a chance to see what real animation was like. This movie was the first foreign film which grossed over 200 million dollars before it came over the US shores. It had beaten Pixar's Ice Age and Disney's Lilo and Stitch to get Best Animated Feature. Yet with all these facts and figures shown to us, does this movie live up to its hype. In a one word answer, YES!However there is no point of handing out the superlatives to a movie, without explaining what the movie is all about. In a nutshell, the movie is about a ten year old girl who is travels to a strange yet enchanting world, after her parents were morphed into pigs. This change of shape was produced by the evil witch, Yubaba, an nasty sorceress who rules over this paralell universe. To avoid detection, the ten year old girl, Chihiro has to work for Yubaba in her bath house. This is where she meets all kind of strange and wonderful characters, like the half man half spider Kamaiji, the mysterious little boy, Haku and many other characters. Though Chihiro had met all these people, her only wish is to go home and turn her parents back to their normal human selves. Watching this movie, has made me wonder why is this feature shown in very small arthouse cinemas and it is on pirate DVDs, when it should be easily shown on the multiplex cinemas. This is a truly amazing movie, whereby the whole story, transports oneself to their earlier childhood. I know that happened to me. Also the movie's animation was totally amazing, in ways that Pixar and Dreamworks would just die for. A good example of this is the flower scene. In conclusion, everyone should watch this movie, whether young or old, japanese or any other nationality, because at the end of the day, this will show you emotions that any other animations will not give you the chance to show."

            "Review": "What made this the hugely successful triumph it was? Was it casting, music, imagination, ingenuity, or luck?I remember opening day at the theaters. I was old enough to remember every scene, every character, every nuance of this film; having committed it to memory forever, as if I would never again be able to see this beloved, instantly loved masterpiece.I also remember that the HIT factor of this movie was so unexpected that you had to wait literal MONTHS to get the action figures promised on the cereal boxes. The pieces were still in the manufacturing process and we had to settle for coupons promising our toys in a few months. I wound up seeing this in the theaters a grand total of 36 times; much to my mother's dismay. She loved the movie as I did, but felt I was obsessed. Today, thirty years later, sitting here writing this review, I realize how right she was. I'm still obsessed with this movie, and with the subsequent movies which followed. I wait in great anticipation for Episode 3. I'm a fan, and I don't care what other people say about Episodes 1 & 2. I don't even mind the \"prequel\" factor, as the situation at the time, dictated to Lucas which movies he would do first.See, I remember the studios saying to him that he had to choose from the three central climactic books, and trash the rest, or just trash the whole idea. He didn't exactly \"sell out,\" he did what he had to do to get his movie...his vision...out there for us to see and experience. I admired his decision then, and I admire it now. Episodes 1-3 are being filmed now, because Lucas had the clout, the money, and the patience to give us his vision...his complete vision and not just the three center books of a 9-book series. I realize that now, there are dozens of books, but at the time, there were nine. And while most of us were happy with Episodes 4-6 and would not have missed 1-3 and 7-9, I personally am so very glad he has taken it upon himself to give us his full vision. I have enjoyed each and every installment with the same sense of awe and joy as I did this one.The casting was the first triumph for this cinematic milestone. Ford is a charismatic and magnetic personality and portrayed Han with a professionalism that you'd expect from more seasoned actors. Sir Alec Guiness is an absolute joy as Obi Wan. His casting was precise and excellent in that part. Carrie Fisher portrayed Leia in a way that, up until then, had never been experienced. Most \"princess\" types before her were whining, whimpering, little snots who were incapable of anything beyond tripping and twisting their ankle in times of peril, while Fisher portrayed her character as a bold, brazen, yet sophisticated and educated woman who was aware of her surroundings and capable of defending herself and her realm with the utmost authority.And Mark Hamil. He was perfectly cast as the whining little boy who wanted more, but was afraid to reach for it. He grows up quite well on film in these three installments, and endears himself to the audience so much the more for it. But a cast member who is almost always left out of these reviews is Peter Mayhew. Chewbacca. His character, as a supporting character to Han's, was exemplary. It's not easy portraying a walking carpet, yet holding the attention, admiration, and love of virtual millions. I am VERY happy about his being cast as Chewy in Episode 3. Couldn't happen to a more deserving...or capable...fellow. Bravo! And James Earl Jones's voice being used as the voice of Darth Vader, was pure genius. His commanding voice haunted the dreams of countless thousands of star-struck children for generations to come. I also have to say that this movie would not have had the charm it does had it not been for Anthony Daniels' C3P0. He is a gift and a joy.The musical score by John Williams featured in this masterpiece was one of the contributing factors. But honestly, this movie's success was such a total surprise to everyone, including Lucas, that nothing could prepare the world for the aftermath of having witnessed this bona fide legend, first hand.The story itself; replete with sub-plot after sub-plot, rich in dialog and detail, was beyond anyone's greatest expectations. Everyone, including Lucas, expected this movie to fail. It is a timeless classic, which I will not repeat here. There are too many movie reviews giving full details of the plot, and I won't be redundant beyond what I have already said.However, that being said, there are a few points I would like to make concerning the symbolism of this endeavor. The Force is a metaphor for the psychic abilities with which we are all born. It was also a metaphor for hope and faith, dedication and commitment to the greater state of being. The Empire is said to have been a metaphor for the Germanic Nazi \"storm troopers.\" While the Rebellion is said to have been symbolic of (what would later become) the NATO forces who defeated them.And then there are the effects. The effects were, in 1977, so awesome; so creative; so ahead of their time, as to ensure this movie's vast success for the next forty years. George Lucas enjoys an almost god-like status among sci-fi/fantasy fans worldwide.This movie does not rate a rating. Usually, when I say that, it is because the movie is so bad, or disappointing that I don't have the heart to rate it. But in this case, it far surpasses any 10/10 rating I could give it.The Fiend :."

            "Review": "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) is a classic phenomenal arguably the best sci-fi film in trilogy away, the one that started all and arguably changed the face of cinema forever. I love this film is actually my number 1 favorite film in the franchise and it is George Lucas masterpiece - the man who make this film happening. He wrote and Directed him self, I love this film to death! I love everything that is in A New Hope. Before I go in to this movie I want to say after watching the new awful horrible movie Episode VII The Force Awakens, I decide to re watch the original Star Wars Trilogy and I have always loved A New Hope and I always will. This was the first film in the trilogy that I have saw as a kid and that I remember. Star Wars are starring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher.The plot is actually more about Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia (Fisher), and its attempt to destroy the Galactic Empire's space station, the Death Star. It is a mission returning the plans of Death Star to the Rebel Alliance, while Galactic Empire want's them back and it is lead by Darth Vader (David Prowse). This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and Special Effects.Star Wars is a film that I have watch it now and I will always watch it , because how much I really, really enjoy this film. This fun, pure joy, entertaining and truly a great film is like a classic, I recommend this film to any fan of the Star Wars trilogy, my favorite will always be A New Hope. This was the film that I have saw the first time as a kid and it grow on me. I love introduction when C-3PO and R2-D2 are walking trough the desert on planet Tatooine and are captured by Jawa traders, who sell them to moisture farmers Owen and Beru Lars and their nephew, Luke Skywalker. Here is the first time we met the character Luke Skywalker. This is the scene where C-3PO is walking trough the desert him self and than he saw someone far away and yells for help. I love this scene and it is the scene I remember from childhood.Which is your favorite character? My favorite character of all time is Luke Skywalker and I really love him so much. My second favorite character will be Han Solo but Luke Skywalker will be the ultimate hero of the galaxy for me.I love this flick, I love the end battle on Death Star, Luke joins the Rebel assault squadron and Luke becomes one of the few surviving pilots. Vader leads a squad of TIE fighters and prepares to attack Luke's X-wing fighter, but Han returns and fires on the Imperials, sending Vader spiraling away. Helped by guidance from Obi-Wan's spirit, Luke uses the Force and successfully destroys the Death Star seconds before it can fire on the Rebel base. I love that scene.I love John Williams score for Star wars which is the best score ever! It is an excellent score makes an actions scenes more exciting and more intense. George Lucas directed this movie well and did an excellent job been a writer as the same time been the director, the pacing is excellent the actors does an awesome job. I also love and I have enjoyed the character Darth Vader and I also love this film because it has a happy ending. Harrison Ford , Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher did all a great joy playing their characters.Carrie Fisher is really gorgeous in this film and for the 70's film it had great pacing and great imaginary story that dose not gives you only a snippet of the backstory. The fight scene between Darth Vader and Obi-Wan \"Ben\" Kenobi was excellent and the death scene of Obi-Wan was a honorable death. Alec Guinness did a perfect job as Obi-Wan \"Ben\" Kenobi he is excellent. Overall: I have said everything about this film that I love I forgot to mention I love Han Solo, Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker (I love to death), Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2. This flick get's a perfect 10 because it is the best beloved science fiction film.R.I.P. Carrie Fisher (1956 - 2016) she was the perfect Princess Leia and she is very missed."

A New Hope is so awesome in so many aspects especially the music and sounds of everything! It's amazing how it was made for it's time I still I don't understand how they did many things. I will admit it has a few bits that are boring but still glorious.

            "Review": "Though now known as \"Episode IV-A New Hope,\" for many of us, namely those of us who first saw this exhilarating entertainment in theaters back in '77, this will always be the first \"Star Wars.\" We will always think of it as just \"Star Wars\" - plain & simple, no pretensions, no aspirations to deep film-making or high art. This is where we first met them all: Luke, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi (old 'Ben'), Chewbacca, the 2 robots C3PO & R2D2 and, of course, Darth Vader. They were instant pop culture icons; you got the sense you'd seen them before somewhere, but were sure this wasn't possible. But they'd been there before in our minds. We'd read about them constantly in science fiction novels and short stories - tales of outer space civilizations, of spaceships zooming through asteroid belts, of exotic-looking aliens hanging around space ports. We'd dream about them at night and try to imagine ourselves in their midst; up until then, we could only imagine such things - there were no projected images to realize such dreams. \"Forbidden Planet\" from 1956 came close, and then there were the \"Star Trek\" and \"Lost in Space\" TV series, both hampered by dime store budgets and cheesy sets. We ate 'em up since there was nothing else. Then Lucas made it real.I remember when I first got wind of the upcoming movie, to open in May of 1977, I think. I saw the first publicized poster and bought the novel adaptation. On the poster, a young man stood with some light sword raised, a princess at his feet, numerous spaceships flying all over the place. I was in my mid-teens and felt the first pulse of building excitement as I realized all those fantastic tales I'd been reading the past few years were going to come alive on the big screen for me. It didn't disappoint. Luke Skywalker, who stood in for all the boys pretending to be on a galactic adventure, gets swept away from his mundane desert home smack dab into the middle of an honest-to-gosh galaxy-wide civil war! The strength of the narrative is / was amazing. There are no slow spots and you can't wait for the next scene during the entire experience; and, experience is the better description for it, rather than just 'movie.' You can't wait, for example, for the moment when Luke actually meets the princess; what will happen then? It's a textbook case of an exciting narrative and what I believe makes this superior to all the sequels (knowing that many feel \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is superior - I must disagree).The one character you really can't wait to see again is the ominous Vader, naturally. The instant he steps into view during the first few minutes of the story, you just know this is the ultimate villain. This is the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool, the supreme uber-evildoer of the entire galaxy. You just know it by his stance, by his attitude, and by the electric chill that runs through your frail form as he steps down the corridor, moving into the annals of film history with one fell swoop. You can't wait to see what he does next, what nefarious action will send someone or some planet to its doom. Sure, he seems under the control of Tarkin (Cushing) here and later, the Emperor, but you just know he's simply biding his time until he takes over the whole damn universe. There is no precedent for Vader, and nothing close to him after. He's at his best here where there's still much mystery attached to his dark frightful form, a minion of Satan and Nazi stormtroopers all rolled into one.This was also the movie-experience which catapulted Harrison Ford (Solo) into superstardom. He seems almost childish here, not really straining to create a character, and it's this flip charm that makes it work, against all odds. He really does appear to have stepped out of the pages of some juvenile space opera, laser guns blazing, all snide remarks and foolhardy bravado. But he also becomes the older brother figure to Luke, who cannot carry the story by himself. Hamill, whose movie career began & ended with Luke, epitomizes the center of destiny for a galaxy. Both humble and arrogant, he's perfect in the role. Fisher's main surprise is that she's not all sugar and sweet as one would expect of a princess. These three characters evolved in the next two films, but they were always at their best here, icons given life for a short period - but also forever in film. The same could be said for Alec Guinness as Kenobi, a first class act all the way. You almost believe this elderly warrior could topple an empire, given enough time. Unless he runs into Vader..."

This is the epic story of good vs. evil and of light vs. dark. But it is also a story of heroism, bravery and adventure. I am an fan-boy, yes, but what is there not to love about \"Star Wars\"?George Lucas really managed to piece together a timeless classic that stands its own even today. And even with effects from 1977 it was light years ahead of its time, no pun intended. And the effects stand their ground even by todays standards.There is something uniquely amazing about the atmosphere and feel of the \"Star Wars\" universe. And it doesn't require much to be swept away and carried along to a galaxy far, far away...The cast in \"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope\" did a good and memorable job with their individual roles and characters. And with this movie George Lucas established some characters that instantly became well-known and well-loved.\"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope\" is a movie of high space adventure with vibrant characters, creatures and spaceships. It is an enjoyable movie for the entire family, space nerds or not.If you are not already familiar with the legendary \"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope\" movie, then it is more than due time to get to it."

            "Review": "\"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...\"Pre review:Its writing started in January 1973, \"eight hours a day, five days a week\", George Lucas said by taking small notes, inventing odd names and assigning them possible characterization... After many drafts, he finally came to a satisfactory conclusion.Then, Lucas presented Star Wars to the United Artists, but they refused to budget the film, so he went to Universal Pictures, the studio that financed American Graffiti; however, it was rejected, as the film concept was \"too strange\".Suddenly, Alan Ladd Jr -head of 20th Century Fox- appeared, a man that trusted in Lucas' genius. And that's how Star Wars became a reality.The shooting of the movie was full of mishaps, problems with practical effects never done before, a bad first edit of the movie, but that didn't stop George from fulfilling his Space Opera. Due to those setbacks, Fox Studios began to put pressure on Lucas to finish the movie. Finally, the movie was done. On the eve of Star Wars release, 20th Century Fox, George Lucas and his cast and crew braced themselves for the worse. One way or another, May 25, 1977 would be a day they would never forget...Review:Star Wars is a modern tale of mythic adventure. It follows the journey and growth of the protagonist: Luke Skywalker. His journey of discovery is set amidst a larger struggle between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance; both parties are embroiled in a civil war. The Empire is comprised of corrupted power within a small group of leaders. These sullied leaders abuse their power over the masses with impunity. It is oppression and repression of the masses. The Empire wants to destroy the hope of the rebellion to ensure the small group of leaders can keep their power...One of the most important features of the movie are the special effects. The use motion control was even superior to Stanley Kubrick's revolutionary masterpiece: \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" thanks to the creation of The Dykstraflex, the first digital motion control photography camera system developed for Star Wars on 1976. Along with an incredibly iconographic character and production design, the movie became stylistically unique.The story and the characters are original and relatable. R2-D2 and C-3PO: the astromech as the optimistic adventurer's desiring to move forward. In direct opposition C-3PO, the protocol droid filled with doubt and reservations. Luke Skywalker, the brave hero, often haunted by doubts and hopes about his future journey. Obi-Wan Kenobi, the wise master and moral guidance of our hero. Han Solo, the rebellious smuggler whose personality represents tenacity. Leia, the damsel \"in distress\", a fearsome princess and general. Finally, Darth Vader, the most iconic character in the franchise, the merciless tyrant in a black suit, representing evil and final conflict of the journey.The film score presents an emotional resonance trough a romantic 1930s Hollywood orchestral score that was commissioned for composer John Williams, who succeeded to create a haunting constellation of operatic leitmotifs.The visual composition is authentic, as Lucas wanted a nostalgic \"filtered look\" so he kept changing key lights for a \"flashing\" effect. He used a loose, \"nervous\" frame, as in newsreels. The dramatic center was displaced, deflecting the eye to background activity, which in later films would include poetically changing weather. This first film gradually turned darker, following a symbolic color scheme where organic brown and warm gold yielded to high-tech black, white, and steely gray.\" This is authenticity is reflected in it's most iconic shot: the 'Binary Sunset' sequence, which establishes the narrative through-line of the story and the world it takes place in, the main value of the scene lies in how powerfully and economically it develops Luke's character: As the suns begin to slowly sink in the evening sky, he gazes towards the horizon, his sense of longing for something more is palpable. Taking things further, he goes on to squint into the distance as if he could see his new future just out of reach, and for the first time we get to see him not as a kid, but for as a new hope.Books such as \"The hero with a thousand faces\" by Joseph Campbell structured the story, The War of Vietnam inspired the battle between the Rebels and the Empire, the lifestyle of buddhist monks characterized the Jedi, real shots of warplanes made the space battles real, Kendo foreshadowed the epic lightsaber duel, Akira Kurosawa's storytelling influenced the focus on minor characters, Fritz Lang's it's iconic protocol droid and John Ford westerns determined it's soul.The fascination with filmmaking and anthropology are the components that allowed Star Wars to be compelling and human, besides being located on a galaxy far, far away.10/10"

I saw the film for the first time three months ago and loved it, and since then I have watched all the Star Wars movies. I was disappointed with the prequels (Attack of the Clones was my least favourite), but this, Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back were perfection.I have to say that the film looks absolutely amazing even after thirty plus years, with highly imaginative sets and dazzling special effects. And the action sequences were superbly choreographed and brisk, the Death Star climax was a knockout. The music by John Williams is absolutely outstanding, by far one of his more exciting and rousing scores. The story is fast-paced, intelligent and has an essence of sophistication, and the screenplay is sharp and decisive.And the performances were flawless. In the prequels I had problems relating to some of the performers, namely Hayden Christensen as Anakin. Here, all the actors played their parts with superlative skill. Alec Guiness, one fine actor and will be sorely missed was a standout, likewise with Peter Cushing and Harrison Ford(hilarious here). Carrie Fisher was a fine Princess Leia, spunky, beautiful and sexy, and Mark Hamill was a completely likable Luke. And the villain Darth Vader, without doubt one of the best and in-depth villains in cinematic history, and James Earl Jones's deep booming voice was perfect for the character.All in all, a definite sci-fi classic, that blew me away. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

            "Review": "Here begins the greatest cinematic epic of all time, and arguably one of the greatest stories ever told. Originally conceived as a serialized popcorn movie in the manner of the old action movies that Lucas grew up with, Star Wars surpassed even George's keen and bombastic imagination to become a central part of movie history.There are countless tales of the making of this movie; how Lucas never believed he would get the chance to complete the series, how it spawned an industry and made the name of nearly everyone who touched it a household word. But what that does not reveal, nor do the much diminished prequels, is the sheer joy and excitement these movies generated.It was a once in a lifetime experience. You could feel it from opening day, earlier if you paid attention to such things. We had never seen anything like it, and we are not likely to again.This episode finds young Luke Skywalker yearning to leave the agrarian life he has with his aunt and uncle, and chase after adventure as his friends before him have already done. And what adventure there is. The galaxy is in the grip of a massive rebellion against a tyrannical and oppressive empire, but on Luke's home planet, it's something you only dare speak of in a whisper.Along come two robots, \"Droids\" for short, who inadvertently involve Luke in a stellar attempt to contact an old wizard named Ben Kenobi, who lives in the caves near Luke's home.The rest is history, and there isn't a person alive in the civilized world who doesn't have at least some awareness of the epic story that unfolds. Luke's rise from adolescent obscurity on Tatooine to a leading role in the greatest struggle of all time is told with humor, action, adventure, and always a sense of story that is unmatched on the screen or on the page.With the completion of the prequel trilogy, these films are enjoying a renewed popularity among a generation that never saw the films on the big screen, and the theatric revivals are almost guaranteed. Go. Get some popcorn. And may the Force be with you."

            "Review": "I can never pick a favorite movie because different movies have different effects. Goodfellas is my favorite drama. Face/Off is my favorite actioner. But when it comes to pure amazement, nothing beats Star Wars. We are introduced to a whole other universe with different creatures, different lifestyles, and different history. We are dropped in the middle of an intergalactic war between an empire and a rebellion that has raged for years and left the universe in ruin. It was the most fascinating thing to see when i was eleven, but to this day i am still a Star Wars nerd.The cast of characters includes some of the coolest, funniest, and most tragic in film, and the actors who play them fit seamlessly into this new universe. Alec Guiness is flawless as Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Jedi on the run from the evil Empire. Harrison Ford is awesome as Han Solo, a smuggler and thief who helps the gang rescue the princess. But the my favorite character of all time is Darth Vader. Not only is he the coolest bad guy, but we learn in later films why he is evil and start to feel sympathetic for him. Not to mention that badass booming voice that can make ordering a pizza sound threatening.This was not only the beginning of the best movie series ever, but it was the beginning of my love for movies. George Lucas is a genius for being able to come up with a great story and an incredible backdrop for what was supposed to be a flop, but turned into one of the best films ever. 10/10"

            "Review": "The awesome special effects and the creation of creatures that are part of the vivid imagination of George Lucas are not the reason for the enduring popularity of Star Wars and the franchise it spawned. Rather it is because of the characters Lucas created that will live as long as we have cinema and the means to display it.The spectacle is behind some real, but simple people. No shadings of gray in the first Star Wars we know without any doubt who the heroes and villains are of this piece. On an isolated planet a galaxy wide dictatorship called the Empire and the revolt against come to wear young Luke Skywalker as played by Mark Hamill and his family reside. So does Alec Guinness, a reclusive and mysterious hermit. An escape pod crashes there with two androids, C3PO and R2D2 and in the latter is a message for Guinness who was at one time a Jedi Knight, fiercest of a warrior class, from Carrie Fisher playing Princess Leia. Also in R2D2 are the schematics for the Empire's ultimate weapon the satellite size death star that can deal killing out on a planetary scale. This starts an adventure with young Hamill who teams up with futuristic soldier of fortune Harrison Ford as Han Solo and his simian like sidekick Chewbacca to rescue the Princess and defeat the Death Star.Those are the good guys. The bad guys are the blackest of black villainy. Peter Cushing cold bloodedly commands the Death Star, but the mysterious Darth Vader, clad in black with a helmet completely covering his head, has mysterious powers and even his superiors are wary of him. The voice of James Earl Jones is unforgettable as the black prince of the galaxy.These are characters that bring out the kid in all of us. The ones who claim the most sophistication in their lives will cheer on for Hamill and Ford and will be fascinated by the double dyed villainy of Darth Vader.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Star Wars and I speak now of all the films is the way such non-humans as the robots and Chewbacca the Wookie became characters. C3PO had dialog, but R2D2 had a few clicks and bleeks and all Chewbacca did was grunt, still they became as identifiable as the human characters.Star Wars set the standard for science fiction films to come for the next several generations. It was given six Oscars in a bunch of technical categories and it's got a re-release value that Gone With The Wind used to have.The Force Will Be With Us Always."

            "Review": "When I first watched this in the cinema I was ten, it was 1977 and I'd never seen anything like it. It had me gripped from the start when a small spacecraft flew past being fired upon by another much larger one that was so big that it seemed to take ages to pass over the viewer. Unlike the recent prequels scenes such as this weren't cluttered with excessive CGI activity but instead showed what was needed in a way that hadn't been seen before. The special effects used throughout the film were ground-breaking for the time and still look great to this day, there is something more real looking about the models used when compared to today's CGI.The main character are all interesting and likable and the acting was all pretty good both from veteran actors like Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing who brought a suitable gravitas to the film and from younger actors Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher who brought a sense of youthful energy.In the unlikely event that somebody doesn't know what the film is about I'll give a brief synopsis; Set in a distant galaxy the forces of the evil galactic empire are hunting down the rebels who are attempting to restore the old republic. They are about to capture a rebel ship which has the stolen plans to the empires latest weapon, the Death Star, when they are hidden in a small robot (droid) by the name of R2-D2 by Princess Leah, he escapes in one of the ships escape pods along with his companion C3PO. They escape to the desert world of Tatooine where they are swiftly captured by strange creatures called Jawas who sell the pair to a farmer who gets his nephew Luke to clean them. While doing so he stumbles across a holographic message addressed to one Obi-Wan Kenobi. While Luke is off having his dinner R2-D2 escapes seeking Obi Wan.The next day Luke sets off to find him but shortly after doing so he is ambushed by Sand People who start ransacking his vehicle till they are disturbed by a robed figure who turns out to be Obi-Wan. He explains to Luke that he was once a Jedi knight and friend of his late father who had been killed by another Jedi called Darth Vader who had turned to the dark side of the force, they also see the full message that R2 is carrying which requests that Obi-Wan takes R2 to the planet Alderaan to get the plans to the rebels. While this is happening Vader who is on the ship searching for the plans dispatches troops to search for the two missing droids. By the time Luke returns home it is too late, the place is a burn out ruin and his aunt and uncle are dead. He decides that he will join Obi-Wan on his mission to Alderaan.They hire a ship, called the Millennium Falcon, from a smuggler called Han Solo who needs the money to pay off a debt and avoid the various bounty hunter who are after him. When they arrive at Alderaan they find it is no longer there, it has in fact been destroyed by the Death Star in an attempt to get Princess Leah to tell them where the rebels are based. Soon after arriving the Millennium Falcon is captured after it goes to investigate a small moon that turns out to be the Death Star. While Obi-Wan is off trying to disable the tractor beam that captured them Han and Luke discover that Princess Leah is being held in the detention area and set off to rescue her... I won't say any more as I don't want to spoil the ending.I think this is a film every body should see at least once, it might not be perfect but if it wasn't for this recent cinematic history would be quite different; it kick-started a revival in science fiction that lead to things like Battlestar Galactica, the return of Star Trek and Alien and was possibly the first \"block-buster\" film. In many ways it was more than just a film it was an event; everybody at my school was talking about it and little else, till one watched it you were completely out of the loop. The characters and there adventures in this and the other films in the franchise have become part of modern folklore.These comments were made based on the video released in the '80s... so no extra CGI and Greedo didn't even attempt to fire before Han killed him."

            "Review": "This great classic has so many good elements it's almost impossible to list them all: The breathtaking visual effects, still awesome 28 years on; the brilliant script, which mixed epic battles and duels with matin\u00e9e-serial-style characters and dialogues; the debut of one of the greatest villains in cinema history, Darth Vader; John Williams'amazing and unforgettable score, among the Top 10 best scores ever...All those things are just some of the reasons Star Wars is among the best movies (not just sci-fi) ever made: viewing after viewing, it never stops being impressive, and words are nearly useless to describe the impact it still has on the audience.George Lucas basically took a medieval story and moved it to a distant galaxy, on weird and fascinating planets. Almost everything is taken from the Middle Ages: there are knights, sword-fighting, evil Empires, unsatisfied people who want to overthrow the system, beautiful princesses waiting to be rescued...Then we've also got speeders, light-sabers, peculiar (and, in the case of Jabba the Hutt, disgusting) creatures, the Death Star, and of course the Force, that fascinating energy which is supposed to bring balance to the galaxy.The cast is a gas, both the newcomers and the veterans: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford are great as Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo (Ford in particular is hilarious as the arrogant but ultimately nice \"scoundrel\"), but the most memorable performance is of course Alec Guinness'portrayal of Obi-Wan Kenobi, the old, wise Jedi who returns one last time to initiate Luke to the mysteries of the Force.But let's not forget what everybody immediately thinks of when Star Wars is mentioned: Darth Vader. Feared by his opponents as well as his servants, this completely emotionless foe has become the very symbol of Lucas'masterpiece. He's one of those movie-characters people will remember as long as films will keep being made and his unsettling breathing noise still echoes in our memories...The beginning of a wonderful saga, whose only rival is The Lord of the Rings.May the Force be with you..."

            "Review": "This story happened 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away'. The galaxy is under the dictatorship of the emperor. Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is part of the rebellion but is capture by the evil Darth Vader. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) the young hero, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) the brigand, his sidekick Chewbacca, and the wise master Jedi Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) must together rescue the princess and save the galaxy.The characters are icons pulled from classic storytelling like Akira Kurosawa's \"The Hidden Fortress\". George Lucas was able to assemble such iconic characters into a well told story. Rarely is a movie change the nature of movie-making, and even the wider culture. This may be on the list of the most important movie ever. It changed the tone of movies from the gritty morally-confused 70s to the popcorn selling blockbusters that are soon to come."

            "Review": "Star Wars is simply a fantastic film, on every level this film is amazing.Each of the characters in this film are so well developed and so interesting that you just cannot wait for the next scene with them in it, the interactions between the characters us at times tense and at times downright hilarious, leaving no room for boring or lacking dialogue. The particular stand outs in this respect I feel are: Han Solo, the wise cracking bounty hunter with a tendency for arrogance that makes every scene as entertaining as possible. Secondly there is Darth Vader, who is the optometry of cool, scathing evil who poses as the ultimate villain.Surprising to me, the cinematography and special effects have held up all this time. Although there are some minor issues, one particularly notable one is during the scene where Luke is training with the training droid aboard the Millennium Falcon there are a few frame skips where Luke extends and contracts his lightsaber. Other than this though, the cinematography and special effects are amazing to have held up, particularly the shots of the Empire's space fleet moving through space which are absolutely stunning.One of the things that absolutely makes this film for me is the magnificent score, composed by John Williams. This score, while being one of the most iconic scores of all time, manages to make every single scene, fitting the mood of the scene perfectly.The story as well is fantastic, there is never a dull moment; every second of it an absolute thrill ride. Whether its the attack on the Death Star or the Cantina of Mos Eisley the story takes you through the twists and turns of this classic space opera.If I could recommend one sci-fi adventure film to someone, it would be this, it's an absolute must see.More Reviews at: http://12yearsacinephile.tumblr.com/"

            "Review": "This is not a review of the first ( and best ) 'Star Wars' movie. I take it, fellow I.M.D.B. users, that you are already familiar with the plot, characters and production history, and how its success changed the face of cinema overnight. So rather than rehash all the known facts, I want instead to recount a personal memory.I first learnt of 'Star Wars' thanks to Granada's 'The Krypton Factor', a long-running game show designed to test contestants' intelligence, physical fitness, powers of observation and so on. I liked the latter round as it often gave one a chance to catch a sneak preview of a new movie. One week, they ran a clip of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, R2D2 and C2PO escaping The Death Star in The Millennium Falcon, and being shot at by pursuing T.I.E. fighters. I fell off my chair. What was this? 1970's sci-fi movies were mostly depressing affairs, predicting gloomy futures for Mankind, now here was something fast, colourful, and lively, with lasers zapping about outer space and explosions. Right up my street.I had to see it. But the film was not yet on release here. There was no Internet then so I got my movie information from the local paper. I kept checking for news of an impending screening at my local cinema, but no - there was nothing. I began to wonder if the movie actually existed or not. Had Granada pulled off the greatest hoax of all time? I read the Sphere book voraciously until I knew the story backwards. I played the Meco disco single at every opportunity. When Marvel's comic adaptation went on sale, I was almost thrown out of the newsagent for jumping up and down for sheer joy.At my school, 'Star Wars' was a dirty word to sci-fi fans, mainly because it was not 'Close Encounters'. The Spielberg picture was regarded as 'adult' and 'intelligent', while the Lucas movie was deemed 'kiddie stuff' starring weirdos in fancy dress running around with a bloke dressed as a big teddy bear.The wait dragged on and on. In an episode of 'Coronation Street', Gail ( Helen Worth ) asked her then-boyfriend, Steve Fisher: \"When's 'Star Wars' coming round here?\" to which he replied: \"It'll be some time I expect.\". His words encapsulated the sheer frustration and impatience felt by all us U.K. fans. The highest grossing film of all time and we can't see it? What is the hold up? Are they redoing bits for the benefit of British audiences? Peter Cushing and Alec Guinness are in it so this cannot be right.In desperation, I told a blatant lie to my best friend. \"I have seen 'Star Wars'\", I proclaimed. He looked about as shocked as if I'd said I'd spent the night with Carrie Fisher. I claimed that my uncle Eric worked for Twentieth Century-Fox ( another lie. He drove taxi cabs for a living ) as an assistant editor and George Lucas had been so impressed with his work on the film, he had generously given him a print. To back up my claim, I reeled off a long list of plot details and scene descriptions. I got a few things wrong, such as Jabba The Hut and Biggs Darklighter, both of whom were excised from the final cut. But by the time my friend saw the film he had forgotten these. He did beg me to ask my uncle to run the film specially for him on Sunday afternoon, but I deflected this by stating that Uncle Eric's projector had broken down. He never asked again.Being about fifteen, I was too old for the toys, hence on Christmas Day 1977 I was denied the pleasure of reenacting the assault on The Death Star in my garden shed, with the aid of elastic bands, old Subbuteo figures and the John Williams soundtrack thumping out of my Hitachi tape recorder.After what felt like an eternity, the movie finally opened here and suddenly it became fashionable to denounce it as 'overrated'. 'It was childish when they were playing trumpets in the Cantina' was my best friend's verdict. That was all he had to say on the subject ( he would have made a great film critic! ). Many people felt that the film had not been worth the six month wait. I was one of the few to speak in its defence. I was glad that sci-fi movies were fun again. Nobody left the theatre with a spring in their step after seeing Milo The Baby Chimp's parents brutally murdered by the U.S. Government at the end of 'Escape From The Planet Of The Apes'.'Star Wars' spawned two sequels, neither as good, and inspired the likes of 'Alien', 'The Black Hole', 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' and countless others. Without Lucas, these would simply not have been made.I am not a big fan of the prequels, but then I'm not young anymore, so can't enjoy that kind of movie in the same way. 'Star Wars' brought 'A New Hope' to those of us wanting old fashioned escapism on the Silver Screen again. I envy kids today for not having to wait until winter for the latest summer blockbuster."

            "Review": "I first saw this film on a warm March Sunday evening in 1978, after queueing for a whole hour to get into the cinema. Oh, the anticipation! The excitement! The magic! And here was a film that changed the whole concept of cinema forever, for no matter how many times I return to it, in the flickering dark of the cinema, or the wondrous, glittering DVD release, or in where the film really scores - at the centre of my imagination, that night will live forever in my memory. ANYTHING was possible, wonders could be achieved. Miracles in the here and now. And how lucky I was to share in it.To the squares that loathe it - I pity you daddyos; you'll never experience what millions of us have felt these past three decades. Go and see Henry Jaglom again; I'll stick with Mr. Lucas - he is THE MAN!I love this film. Forget what flaws it has - minor they are indeed. Star Wars has become a mystic myth and that sorcerer supreme, Jedi master George Lucas, has given me more pleasure than I can measure. My favourite bit? Almost impossible to choose. Okay, if I must...the stunning Tie Fighter battle with the Millennium Falcon, a work or art in the editing room. It should be hung on a wall somewhere.George, old chap, if you're ever passing my house please knock - and I'll make you a cup of tea. You deserve that much at least!"

            "Review": "And yes, I'd consider this more of an action film than Sci/fi since it takes place in contemporary times and locations. Nowadays, it can be hard to distinguish an action film from a video game. In fact there is one coming out soon that appears to be both. I guess studios these days feel that kids need something to see while resting their fingers after long days of playing their Nintendos/Playstations/whatever. So they come up with all of these PG-13 action films that are often mere meditations of comic books, toys, or old TV shows. Looking back at T2, one may find the action films of today sorely lacking in comparison.The story of course deals with Arnold returning from the future to protect a boy who will some day lead the human resistance against a world run by machines. This time Arnold is the good guy (as per Schwarzenegger's request) and he's up against a lethal and much more advanced prototype sent to off the kid. The CGI used to create this new T-1000 terminator was jaw-dropping at the time this was released. Though technology to create such things is now infinitely more available, this has led to problems in my book. Now, there is too much done with computers, and stunts don't seem so wonderful if you know it was all done on a computer. Most of the stunts in T2 were live action and extraordinarily filmed using all types of vehicles and explosives. Director James Cameron really sold these stunts in terms of how he filmed them.Not all directors are a good as Cameron. That is a given. But directors looking at making action films should take note of other strengths found in the construction of T2. First of all, you don't need shaky camera movements to sell to your audience that there is an exciting or crucial scene happening. Here the photography is crisp and detailed. You see everything clearly that you need to see. Right down to the little things. The action sequences are perfectly blocked and the spacing between hostile parties is easy for the audience to figure out. We know who is shooting at who, and how far apart they are from each other. Cameron also made sure his entire cast was proficient with the weapons they were going to fire in the movie. And guns run out of ammunition and need to be re-loaded at appropriate times. Nothing seems artificial in a shootout.I could go on forever pointing out good qualities of this film. Just watching a bit of it on Bravo the other night reminded me why I saw it so many times in the theater. And this film was rated R! And it still made a fortune! That just proves if you make a good product, you don't have to dumb it down or tame it for the kiddies. If it's good enough, they'll find a way to see it! 10 of 10 stars. Unfortunately, the inspiration seems to have left this series with Cameron.The Hound."

The people in my country watched this film when there where limited VHS cassettes at all. And again, my favorite Director did an timeless epic-masterpiece. Yes, an epic. Every scene in this movie is beyond the perfection. The timeless plot. Groundbreaking effects. Unforgettable \"Hasta la vista, baby.\" .Perfect direction for a sci-fix action film. When the action starts, you're in for the ride of your life. There never be the same movie like T2. What else I can say about this film? A Must see for everyone."

            "Review": "Normally when people tell you about a sequel that was better than the original or just as good, Terminator 2 is always guaranteed to be in their list; why? Because this is THE action movie of all action movies, next to Die Hard, this is the movie that isn't just about the action as well, but has an incredible story and message behind it that will always stay with you. Terminator 2 like the first Terminator film has memorable lines, moments, and incredible effects. This is the film that made you believe in \"liquid metal\" machines. Robert Patrick's performance is flawless, to be honest I found him a million times more terrifying than Arnold in the first Terminator, because Robert looks like this normal average guy, but he's not like Arnold where he gets shot and you can clearly see he's a terminator, Robert goes back to human looking and won't stop. Not only that you don't know how to stop him. Linda Hamilton returns and gives a great performance as Sarah Conor who is no longer a meek little girl, she has turned into a strong woman who will do anything to protect her son and the future. Arnold is back and he's better then ever! No wonder in the future they made several terminators that look like him, he's great entertainment.Eleven years after Sarah Connor destroyed the original Terminator that was programmed to kill her, two Terminators arrive in Los Angeles from the year 2029. The first is a Terminator identical to the one that Sarah first encountered, while the second is a new model which assumes the identity of a police officer. John Connor is now a 10 year old living with foster parents. Sarah's experiences have made her tougher and more vigilant, but also desperate to warn humanity about the coming apocalypse. After attempting to bomb a computer factory, Sarah is arrested and remanded to the Pescadero State Hospital for the Criminally Insane under the supervision of Dr. Silberman. Meanwhile, the Terminators locate John Connor in a mall. After John is rescued and a chase through the L.A. storm drain channels, the original Terminator escapes with John on his motorcycle. The Terminator explains that he is reprogrammed by the future John Connor to protect and obey John's younger self. The other Terminator is a T-1000, an advanced new prototype programmed to kill John. It is made of \"a mimetic polyalloy\", a liquid metal that allows it to take the shape and appearance of anything it touches. It can also form into knifes and stabbing weapons. Learning that the T-1000 will likely kill Sarah and then mimic her to lure John, John orders the Terminator to help free her. Initially, Sarah is terrified by the Terminator; but after seeing it fight off the T-1000, she accepts that they need its help. As they escape the city, the Terminator informs John and Sarah about Skynet, the sentient computer system that will nearly wipe out humanity in an apocalyptic nuclear attack on \"Judgment Day\".Terminator 2 is one of the best films of all time, this is a film that I absolutely adore and if someone hasn't seen it, there's something seriously wrong. This story is a special one: humans, are we our own worst enemy? Arnold's line \"It's in your nature to destroy yourselves\" is something that always sends chills down my spine because it's true. I loved the relationship between Arnold and Eddie Furlong, interesting to see a terminator take the place perfectly of a father and you see the pain in Eddie's eyes of never wanting to let go of the terminator. Like Sarah Conor said \" The terminator wouldn't stop, it would never leave him. It would never hurt him or shout at him or get drunk and hit him or say it was too busy to spend time with him. And it would die to protect him.\" meant a lot to me. Like I said, if for some odd reason you have seen this movie, do see it! I promise you that it's just an excellent film and one that will always stand out against cinematic history.10/10"

Sarah Conner is labelled insane after trying to burn down Cyberdyne Systems, the company that hid the remains of the first terminator she destroyed, and she is committed to a mental institute. John Resents his mother for the way he was brought up, and now lives with his foster parents.Again the machines send a Terminator the T-1000, but the resistance have one of their own. Sent back to protect John, Arnie is the same make and model, but has a new mission, this time he's on our side.Is Arnie a match for the new T-1000, a liquid metal terminator that can morph into anything it samples by physical conduct. Groundbreaking special effects and non stop action sequences ensue as the war between Terminator's boils into one of the finest action movies of all time.Simply Brilliant in every way.10/10"

            "Review": "Who said sequels aren't any good? \"Terminator 2\" is the ultimate sequel, a big bad wolf ready to chomp the head off of anyone who crosses its path. It's dark, it's mean, and it's one tough movie. It's not as bleak as the first film, at least in terms of visuals, but rather has a new kind of bluish-tint that supplies a great backdrop to the ongoing battle between man and machine.If there was ever a contemporary mainstream visionary director, it is James Cameron. Here we've got Cameron's real thoughts on the series, those repressed by a low budget in the original film. He lets loose here, filling every frame with hard-boiled action and special effects. He introduces a liquid metal Terminator that he wanted to use in the first film, but graphic processors and CGI were not advanced enough in 1984, at least not advanced enough to work on the low means he had to film the original. So his original dream is finally unveiled, and good golly, is it wonderful.Yeah, he's \"back.\" Arnold (like he needs any introduction?) returns as The Terminator, Series T-101, Model T-800, an indestructible cyborg sent from the future to assassinate Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) in the first film. Well, it's 1991. New film. New mission. He has to save the future resistance leader of mankind who will ultimately defeat the machines of the future, John Connor (Edward Furlong), Sarah's 11-year-old son. (Though his age has been switched from 11 to 13 and back to 9 over the years, with no help from the third film that takes place in 2003, yet claims he was 13 in 1991 though his age doesn't match with his age in the third. We'll just leave it at 11 in this film. Got that?)Another model Terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), has been sent back to 1991 programmed to annihilate John Connor. Which explains Arnold's appearance. Arnold, an undoubtedly lesser opponent compared to the T-1000, has to help save the day and learn to appreciate humanity. It won't be easy. First, he has to find John Connor, who is a rebellious angst-driven pre-teen living with foster parents. Then, together they have to break into the local loony hospital and release Sarah from the clutches of Dr. Silberman (Earl Boen), who believes Sarah is delusional. (You may remember Silberman as the psychiatrist from the first film, too.) Then, they have to stop a computer chip designer (Joe Morton) from creating the first version of a SkyNet computer, modeled after a destroyed chip his employment company discovered at a large mechanical warehouse. (Which is, of course, the chip from the destroyed T-800 of the first film.)Whew. On with the film analysis, right? Where to start? This isn't as fierce or brutal as the first film, but it's got plentiful action sequences, a large budget, great special effects (even compared to those gracing the screen nowadays), not to mention a great character study of the machine we loved to root against in the first film. Of course, this Terminator has no memory of the first film, since he wasn't in it--SkyNet creates hordes of the same version machines on a large conveyor belt and ships them off to fight in the war. Some are sent back through time. So, with that in mind, John Connor's resistance found an extra Arnold lying around in an abandoned warehouse, programmed him to keep John Connor out of harm, and sent him through the time portal.Sarah doesn't trust him. In a deleted scene available on the Ultimate and \"Xtreme\" edition DVDs, Sarah says, \"You don't know what it's like to try and kill one of these things!\" It's an important scene that should have been left in the final cut. In it, Sarah is about to destroy the machine's central processing chip located inside his head, when John stops her. It's important because it focuses on the fact that Sarah still doesn't trust him, and came close to destroying him purely out of prejudice, without giving him a chance. As much as I don't like it when people go on about hidden meanings in films that obviously are not meant to have hidden meanings and are purely little flubs made by directors unrightfully analyzed for deeper meaning(s), \"T2\" clearly has an underlying message: One, don't judge a book by its cover. Read it first. Two, if an emotionless killing machine can learn to appreciate life, why can't everyone? And three, the most important fact of all: Never mess with a muscular man who walks into a bar completely naked and requests your clothes and means of transportation.I suppose the question on most interested viewers' minds is this: Is \"T2: Judgment Day\" better than its predecessor? Well, in some respects, yes. In others, no. It lacks the fierce brutality and darkness of the first film, but makes up for it with spectacular visual effects and action sequences. It lacks the horrific central focus of the first film (futuristic, indestructible cyborgs with no feelings being able to unemotionally kill), but it makes up for this with a new focus of humanity, coming to accept your future, and how it would look if two colossal killing machines entered into an arena together.In some ways, I like the first better. But then I think about the second film and I have a hard time choosing. I suppose if I had to choose I'd choose the first film. And let me just state for the record that I'm glad I don't have to choose.5/5 stars."

            "Review": "Terminator 2: Judgment Day is (1991) is the best action sci-fi flick movie from the 90's ever made of all time. Terminator 2 is my personal favorite film I absolutely love this movie to death! Is my number 1 best movie ever till today the best of the best epic movie of all time. T2 was nominated for 4.Oscars the only movie of the franchise was nominated for an Oscar. If you watch T2 carefully and follow the story you never got bored and you are very entertained. This movie kicks ass! I love the hospital scenes mostly at night, the Cyberdyne building action sequences and of course steel mill action sequences are perfect for this film. This film deals with a lot of action, sci-fi and does involves a lot of paradox past travel. There is a lot of explosions and automatic weapons used in the movie and they are used well thousands of bullets are fired and explosive projectiles are fired at the police cars. Arnold Schwarzenegger as the good terminator T-800 did an awesome Terrific real job, he acted believably as one of his best characters I ever saw on screen. Terminator walks to the front of the building and kicks a desk out a window. Than ignores the police's order to surrender and fires a M134 Minigun with Chainsaw grip at the police cars below, avoiding the humans. The helicopter pilot moves away. Terminator than uses a M79 grenade launcher to destroy two more vehicles. Its heads-up display indicates no human casualties. The film has a heart and is the best film in the world. Robert Patrick as T-1000 is \"a mimetic Polly-alloy\" or \"liquid metal.\" He can shape shift to match other people he touches, after first arriving in present time, he decides to have his base form be that of a nearby cop he killed and passes himself off as a cop in that form. The truck chase scene is awesome and the crash is also awesome. The truck that hit in to another column in the canal and explodes, T-1000 emerges as a shiny, featureless, liquid metal figure. Its features become more pronounced and its colors return to normal, returning to the form of the unharmed pseudo-cop is awesome. It shows what his character can do. Linda Hamilton is the only Sarah Connor she acted her character perfectly here she played her character genius and very convincing and real, tough beyond all belief and completely focused on preventing the nuclear war and ensuring John's safety. Sarah Connor is her best performance ever in the both Terminator films. Little out of her mind with paranoia and anger: amazingly, you see actual character development (specifically, when John and T101 arrive at Dyson's house to prevent her from doing what she wants to). Edward Furlong, is the only John Connor for me, is not bad himself as the extroverted kid who's confused by the fact that everyone except his mom told him his entire upbringing was based on a lie. The bit players all do their jobs well. Earl Boen plays the semi-sadistic mental hospital warden Dr. Silberman from the first film The Terminator (1984) that stands between Sarah Connor and her son (until the T1000 makes a chilling entrance).Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong and Robert Patrick did there best acting performances, those actors who played there characters are beloved till this days and Terminator 2 has since been ranked as one of the greatest action, science fiction sequel films of all time. Twin sister of Linda Hamilton also appeared as Leslie Hamilton Gearren as Twin Sarah in dream she was for real there wasn't no CGI in here. Twin brothers Don Stanton and Dan Stanton both of actors appeared in here one as Lewis the Guard the other as Lewis as T-1000 who kills lewis they were for real no CGI, except special effects for T-1000 knife. Terminator special effects were designed by Stan Winston R.I.P. who has done incredible job making those effects. The film is absolutely filled with great, classic moments. T2 is James Cameron masterpiece. This wouldn't be an action movie without some action. James Cameron writes, produces and directs brilliantly this film. Brad Fiedel does a perfect music score to the film. American rock band Guns N' Roses wrote a single for this movie \"You Could Be Mine\" and Schwarzenegger appeared in the music video as T-800 in the music video for this movie. The chopper scene that crashed in to a SWAT van and explodes was awesome. The CGI and special effects are awesome. This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task actors, stunts, puppetry, models and special effects designed from Stan Winston. It is Rated R for strong sci-fi action and violence, and for language, it is a perfect film from the 90's that I have grew up with it. 10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval"

            "Review": "The original Terminator film is one of the greatest films of the action genre, and still holds up as a fantastic film, not just of its genre but in general too. Terminator 2: Judgement Day is considered one of the best sequels ever made, and it is a consensus that I agree with. While it does lack somewhat in its predecessor's darkness and brutality, it delivers just as much in the writing and action and feels bigger and richer.Here in Terminator 2: Judgement Day the budget is clearly bigger. This is especially true in the special effects, they were the only things in the first film that didn't hold up as well as the rest of the film but they were still not bad at all, here the effects are stunning, the liquid melting effects on the T-1000 model blow the mind still today. It is photographed slickly and beautifully, maintaining the dark audaciousness of the first film., and while the sets and lighting are not quite as nightmarish they are every bit as imaginative and atmospheric. It is superbly directed by James Cameron, and it's scored appropriately hauntingly.Terminator 2: Judgement Day's script is just as snappy and even takes on a hard-edged tone in some parts, more so than the original, while the roller-coaster action is thrilling in every sense, without being overblown or dominating the film too much at the expense of depth, the bigger budget aiding and adding to the experience rather than swamping it. The story is still enormous fun, beautifully paced with few if any longueurs and very suspenseful.Linda Hamilton gives another terrific performance, that is more depth than her performance in the first film, Robert Patrick is spine-chilling and once again Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast in by far his most conic role that was tailor-made for him.In conclusion, a fantastic sequel that deserves its distinction as one of the best sequels ever made. It's the only Terminator sequel to be close to the quality of the original, and the only one that's above good level. For me, if asked which is the better film between the first film and this they're about equal, in their own ways 10/10 Bethany Cox"

            "Review": "Terminator 2 perhaps shows that Cameron was at least was cognizant of life and its meaning. I mean, this IS the movie where the end of the world has the most impact outside of Dr. Strangelove, right? One of those outstanding dream scenes in movies, one of the ones that actually works because it's true in its savage simplicity, Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor sees herself in her 1984 waitress get up with baby John in a playground and then everything gets wiped out by the BIG BOMB (Dmitri) that also incinerates Hamilton into BBQ.So it's with this kind of thought that Terminator 2 means to be the most kick-assingest blockbuster of its (or all?) time while trying to keep the loss of life very small - or, rather, the \"Bad\" Terminator who was designed by the wizards at ILM can kill to its mission's content - I mean, DAMN, it still looks great, and in its silver-liquid-chrome simplicity much more, for me, impressive than the clanging junk of Bay disasters. It's arguable, of course, that the Terminator (T-800) does kill some people, incidentally, or, you know, all that gas from the gun he shoots could make some people really screwed up but, hey, \"He'll live\" is enough.But if Cameron is \"soft\" at all here, it doesn't show too much... well, okay, Lil' John (hehe) does squeak and squak those early 90's amorphisms \"No Problemo - chill out - listen to Kriss Kross - etc\", and Edward Furlong is one of the things that just does not hold up here. He's serviceable at best, annoying at worst. He can cry okay though.But it's Arnold, in his swaggering low-key and then with an occasional grin awesome leading man turn, and especially Linda Hamilton who make this tight script so compulsively watchable. Hamilton makes Connor into what Cameron likely saw in his one-time wife/collaborator Bigelow - a take-no-prisoners soldier who can take charge and has muscles and can probably knock you upside the head (maybe that's why they divorced, he couldn't take all that woman... but I digress, at any rate he moved around a lot till his current wife) And there is also a vulnerability still to Sarah that makes her so endearing. She can never be completely hard, though time and experience and the dread of what's to come had scarred her, so by the time she has the chance to kill the Man Who Destroys The World, she can't do it. A scene like that is probably more emotionally gripping than so many other scenes that try in these blockbusters (something like Days of Future Past, which is a cousin of this flick, gets there). The fact Hamilton wasn't able to parlay such high caliber performance work into a better career is kind of sad, but at least this stands as a benchmark of a woman action hero, one of the two Cameron Wonder Women really.So, blast your Guns N Roses, say hi to the kid from Salute Your Shorts (that's him, right, Connor's friend in the first act?) and ride your motorcycle through LA - it's a bad mother-jammer of a blockbuster that holds up enough to look over its faults (i.e. some dialog isn't tight, like the voice-over, it's alright but whatever - perhaps it was ambitious enough to best The Perfect Action Movie, which the first Terminator just was)."

            "Review": "At the time of release, this was one of the biggest, most expensive, box office hits ever made. Obviously that reputation has long since been diminished by films which have come since, but I still remember the hype and excitement that surrounded this film when I was but a ten year old boy. Containing Arnold Schwarzenegger's most accessible, likable performance, it's difficult to find fault with this near-masterpiece of adrenaline-pumping action.Essentially it's just a string of set pieces linked together by a few scenes of dialogue. There's little drama or acting involved - all the characters are clear-cut - basically, the film goes from one outstanding action sequence to another. And these action scenes are truly wonderful. There are five in all; each more exciting and meaningful than the last. The first comes when the T-800 and T-100 finally meet up and have a huge battle in a hallway, smashing walls down and throwing each other through windows. The battle of the titans continues outside in a riveting truck chase, stopped only by a huge explosion. The third suspenseful set-piece shows just how unstoppable the T-1000 is, as the goodies and baddies battle over rescuing Sarah Connor from her mental asylum. Then there's lot of gunfire and explosions in the Cyberdyne building siege, until the final climatic battle between good and evil at a steel mill.If THE ABYSS was the first film to really introduce CGI, TERMINATOR 2 is the first film to really make use of its facilities and to place them in a context - unlike later entries which tried to make non-computerised things look real, and failed. The T-1000's morphing shots are stunning, show-stopping, and exceptional, and they work because they are meant to look as such. Aside from these excellent morphing sequences (the scene involving the T-1000 coming out of a floor is probably the greatest), there's tons of ammunition and explosions flying across the screen at every opportunity. Arnie dons some realistic \"wound\" makeup in the final scenes of the film, and once again the makeup is flawless. The special effects are the best things in this film; the makeup, CGI work and stunts all come together in absolute perfection.The performance are spot on too; characters are introduced and are made charismatic, but thankfully are not dwelled upon. Edward Furlong makes an impressive debut as the streetwise, foul-mouthed kid who has a heart of gold, while Linda Hamilton has undergone a complete transformation from her victimised waitress in the first film to a muscular, lean killing machine herself. Robert Patrick helped to carve himself a niche for playing evil psychopaths, and his slim figure goes well with the morphing capabilities he possesses - he looks like a match for Arnie. But it's our friend Schwarzenegger who steals the film, starting out as a cold, calculating machine and in the end sacrificing himself for mankind. That this finale had me bursting into tears on more than one occasion shows just how good Arnie is in it. He's funny, heroic, likable and consistently impressive - what more could you want? Other familiar faces fill out the supporting cast, with the likes of Xander Berkeley and Earl Boen (returning from the first film) in minor roles.The violence isn't skirted, either...lots of people get impaled by the T-1000's knife-arms, plenty of men get shot in the knees (ouch), Arnie even cuts the skin off his own arm at one point. But this is primarily an action film, and should be treated as such. Every scene is flawlessly composed, with some little neat ideas thrown in almost everywhere - everything is portrayed coolly and stylishly, especially where Arnie is concerned. He really is the king of cool here - from the flick as he puts on his sunglasses to the shotgunning open of locked gates in split seconds to his final catchphrases - \"Hasta la Vista baby\" and \"I'll be back\" to name but two. And still there's more to praise: a moral behind the story, a suspenseful score, excellent opening titles, no lulls in the film whatsoever, nice photography, crisp editing...the list is, indeed, endless. In my youth, this was my most-watched film, and I can still watch it over without ever becoming bored. A masterpiece, plain and simple, and one of my very favourite films."

Bought the VHS in '94 n saw countless number of times that the VHS nearly got burned out. Bought a DVD recently n revisited it. T2 is a timeless movie. It is much better than the original. It has superb car chases, big guns, dynamic explosions, gore, tension, suspense, etc. The chase sequence is awesome and nail bitingly intense, it is one of the best action sequences ever made. The pacing is impeccable and the action sequences still stands out. This movie has awesome sound effects, perfect cinematography n impeccable editing. I don't think there must b an action fan who hasn't seen this movie. It has an awesome cgi, action n sound effects. The scene in the Institute where Arnie walks in slow motion with a shot gun n Patrick, the cold emotionless killer, approaching is so full of tension. This movie also has a creepy n dreadful atmosphere. The movie is very violent n action packed."

            "Review": "A Terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger) was sent from the future to kill the unborn son of Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton) in the original. Now, that Terminator has been sent back again but with a different assignment: Protect John Connor. John Connor(Edward Furlong) is now about 10 years of age and must evade a new Terminator sent to kill him;The T-1000(Robert Patrick). Sarah, John, and The Terminator journey together on their quest to stop Judgement Day, with a trailing, shape-shifting Termiantor trailing from behind.This is the greatest of the Terminator trilogy. I have watched three times in the past year and have not found anything that Cameron could have improved on. The move is a masterpiece in every aspect of film. Schwarzenegger's acting might not be incredible but this is the perfect role for him. He isn't supposed to show emotion or feelings. He is a machine. I hate almost every one of his movies besides this trilogy because he is a horrible actor but he works perfectly into this role.The special effects are incredible beyond belief. The shape-shifting T-1000 is some of the greatest animation I have witnessed in cinema history. It absolutely blew my mind when I first experienced this visual extravaganza. The animation looked so real(remembering this was a good ten years). The movie included fast-paced action along with some clever sci-fi drama/horror. The idea of a vast army of machines taking over the world after sending off warheads to every major city should be scary enough. But the T-1000 has very little lines and is just creepy enough to make twitch when you see him.Sci-fi movies can rarely be made in such way that can be looked at as works of art. This is one of the few exceptions. The prediction of judgment day with Hamilton watching a playground full of kids be burnt to the ground is an absolute brilliant portrayal of Armageddon. The theme that men will destroy themselves is also shown throughout the movie also and is even said by The Terminator\" It's in your nature to destroy yourselves\". This brings the movie to a whole new level of sci-fi.Overall, Termiantor II: Judgement Day is an absolute must see classic. If you have not seen it, buy it! Because once you have seen it, you will want to do so anyways. It is fast paced and highly enjoyable for just about every audience.I highly recommend this movie."

            "Review": "The future John Connor has sent a T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to protect the teenage John Connor (Edward Furlong) from the most advanced Terminator ever, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). It's mimetic poly-alloy material allow it to mimic anything it touches. John must retrieve his mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from the psychiatric hospital.The CG T-1000 is the most advanced FX of its times. For the rest, it is all real action. It still looks exciting and hasn't aged too badly. James Cameron has pushed the envelop to the limits. This is not simply Terminator on steroids. Cameron has added a lot of humor, and also heart. The T-101 is more a father figure to John Connor. And Sarah Connor's tough love really adds to the heartbreak. And the central idea that the future is still their's to create. All of it makes this more than a simple shoot 'em up movie. This is one of the best sequel ever."

            "Review": "Oh yeah, \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\"......The greatest overall action film next to \"Die Hard\" and the greatest science fiction one next to \"Aliens\". It is, without a doubt, my favorite movie of all time and I would give this 20 stars if I could and this is a film that everyone recognizes and knows about and this is a film that absolutely gets what it deserves.In 1991, Arnold Schwarzenegger had finally cemented his reputation as the world's greatest action star after a couple great classics (The Terminator, Predator, Total Recall and the Conan films). This is the movie that defined Schwarzenegger forever as the one and only \"Terminator\", the cyborg sent from the future to protect the kid (Edward Furlong) who will save the entire world. Even though he's a machine, he learns what humans need to do and what they were put on this Earth for. And like what action films lack, T2 develops its characters flawlessly, and yes, EVEN the Terminator is given development as a character! When the T-100 arrives to the mid 1990's, he is basically awkward and socially clueless and knows nothing about human emotion or interaction. As the film progresses, he learns how humans behave and learns a few one-liners from John (Hasta la Vista, baby) and Spoilers: at the end before the Terminator melts himself in molten steel, his humanity is completely obvious, \"I know now why you cry, for it is something I can never do.\" And just before he completely disappears in the molten steel, he gives the \"thumbs-up\" gesture, something that John had taught him before.It is also probably the most heart-breaking ending and even the most insensitive guy will cry to that.Also, Linda Hamilton makes one of the greatest ever screen performances by a female, and even challenges the performance of Sigourney Weaver in \"Aliens\". And her character has really developed from the first movie. The main problem with most movie sequels that have been made is that they usually act like the film before it never happened. But Sarah Connor has transformed from a timid waitress into a smart and brutal militaristic woman. And it shows off James Cameron's film-making genius and he truly knows how to make a great action film and a great sequel to follow it, because of this and \"Aliens\" (which I will write up a review soon) 2 of the greatest sequels ever made. During the course of this film, Sarah Connor has already developed a phobia for Terminator's due to her experiences in the first movie. And during most of the film, she doesn't trust the Terminator at all and even tries to destroy its CPU chip (only in a deleted scene). But at the end, when the Terminator is just about to destroy itself, she shakes hands with him and makes peace with him.....very,very touching moment. Also, Hamilton did a great job at providing the narration, with some greatly written lines, and she utters them with perfect drama and suspense to reveal the story in the beginning and what's next for the future at the end.Also, Edward Furlong really makes a name for himself in his film debut. He is absolutely perfect as the juvenile offender who is affected by the absence of his mother and biological father. Throughout the film, he becomes attached to the Terminator and teaches him the meaning of human life. And no one else could've done the role better or equally as great. FYI, it's not really that easy for a kid with limited acting experience to pull it off.The line, \"She's not my mother, ''Todd''\" shows what Furlong can do and says that line with the perfect facial expression and delivery. And Furlong and Hamilton are really the 2 who provide the intense emotion that has capitalized James Cameron's films ever since.The villainous T-1000 (Robert Patrick) has gotta be the icon for movie villains, 'cause the whole \"liquid metal\" thing is so cool. And the film was even a landmark for special effects which make the action scenes stand out and make them among the best in the genre.This is further proof of why every action fan needs to have James Cameron alive to give em a reason to live. I'm already looking forward to \"Avatar\" and \"Battle Angel\", and I'm sure those 2 will kick @$$ once they come out.If it weren't for this film, every other action flick that you see these days wouldn't be the same. When you watch it, just keep in mind that this movie changed a lot of things. It's not just an excellent action epic, but a very emotionally charged story about human survival."

            "Review": "Probably this is the movie I enjoyed watching the most. Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of my all time favorite actors, I am a huge fan of him. It does not matter whether his acting is great or not (but in this movie, he is great I think) The Terminator 2 has humor at times, but because of that again rather critics give one star low! However, humor in the movie is not to entertain audiences. Humor in this movie results from natural situations, it seems that Cameron does not put such moments for our entertainment like the third Terminator movie. And this humor does not ruin the seriousness and the dark tone of the movie. I can't think of a Terminator movie without Schwarzenegger. I have seen Terminator Salvation and yes, there was Arnold Schwarzenegger too, but CGI! (an awful idea) Terminator Salvation was OK, but not as a Terminator movie, as a post apocalyptic science fiction action. I want to say a few things more about Schwarzenegger. He was an icon by this character. Motorcycle, leather jacket, sunglasses and pump rifle. At this point, this is the most humanist, may be the only action movie ever! One of my favorite one liners is the movie is ''he will live.'' Connor tries to teach him not to kill people. Don't get me wrong, it does not mean that I don't like other action movies which do not give such a message, but this just makes the movie greater and deeper. By the way, Terminator 2 is also the deepest action movie ever. This is one of the movies that when you replace any of the actors, pieces don't fall into place. Schwarzenegger is like he was made for Terminator (and yes Conan too), Robert Patrick was made for T-100 (he was at his best in this movie, may be not for acting, but for performance) and Edward Furlong was made for John Connor. Honestly, personally it was impossible to believe that Nick Stahl is John Connor, I watched him like another character. Furlong portrays a very realistic rover portrait. As for Linda Hamilton, she was not made for Sarah Connor, but it is a big pleasure to watch her and for her acting, real very good. Musics always make me live nostalgia, great musics. Now, let's talk about the scenes. The atari center sequence is the first beyond great sequence. This movie is great entertainment, every time, it is a great pleasure to watch it. From the middle of 1990s till now, I watched the movie almost 50 times. I love the metal holes and then renew. How creative it is. As for visual effects, it is a touchstone, yes still. It is the greatest visual effects of all time to me, till 2012. Now, to me it became the second greatest. And I am sorry, I find the visual effects of T2 much more believable than Avatar. Yes I know, 3D, some other new technologies as well. but this is what I think. At a few moments, it is flawed like the scene they shoot at the face of Schwarzenegger, but no problem at all. Can you believe that this movie was made in 1991? I can't believe at all. That's why it is still a milestone. The chase sequence in the highway is beyond great too. Cameron raised the bar and I used to compare all the chase scenes with this one. Do you know another movie that in user comments, the titles which say the greatest action movie ever are innumerable? Almost everyone says the greatest action movie ever, the best action movie of all time, the greatest, the best... I will say the same thing. This is the greatest action movie of all time. The pump rifle using style of Terminator was getting my attention when I was a child. Still I like that. I just like gunfight scenes, not guns by the way. The hospital sequence is the third beyond great sequence, there are a lot of scenes that deserves cinema anthology in this movie. The coffee scene was incredible, every time makes me remember The Silver Surfer, we get lots of very interesting and brilliant moments like the shoot at head (not just in this sequence, throughout the whole movie) The Terminator is 10 out of 10, but T2 surpasses even that (you know I can't give 11 out of 10) Ohh By the way, I don't recommend you to watch the extended edition, if you are a first time viewer. There are three new scenes in this edition. The scene which Sarah hallucinates, to me a mediocre scene, the scene which T-100 tells Sarah and John where his chip is, an unnecessary scene and the scene which a kind of foreplay and talking between Tarissa and Miles while he works at desk, a clich\u00e9 and a bit ridiculous scene. Returning to the movie, this is the best cat and mouse game movie with No Country for Old Men, it wouldn't be better. T-1000 is the most powerful, the most resistant (the most indestructible) villain ever! You think that he is terminated, but he is not, will he be terminated this time? The movie delivers such a feeling that I would define great success. Helicopter truck fight is great, another action sequence, I would call the kind of action in the movie metallic, not CGI action. By the way, mercury scene was one of the most shocking moments in the cinema history! Unbelievable, incredible. There is an unaccountable moment which it seems that Hulk was inspired from. Another moment recalls The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King etc. If you watched both movies, you understand what I mean. And T-1000 continues to execute his tricks, I was bowling over every time. This is a non stop action movie, but not shallow at all, not like pure action with no substance, in contrast the deepest action movie ever made."

            "Review": "Let it be said right away: There is at least one obvious issue with this. That doesn't have to include the fact that this is one of those sequels that are so much like the original that one could argue that it's partially a remake. What I'm referring to is that going by the first, it technically shouldn't exist. I am not aware of anyone who considers the predecessor of this to be the only film in this series(I've experienced many who, with good cause, deny there to be a third movie... heck, I am one of them), but I could see why there could be. However, if you look past that(and you ought to at least consider doing so, as this doesn't come off as one of those follow-ups released to cash in on an earlier success), you're in for an undeniably enjoyable and well-done cinematic experience. The plot is interesting and well-told. The pacing is solid. The acting is great from all, Patrick is an incredible addition, and neither Arnie nor Linda have forgotten how to portray their role. The action gets bigger, and still consists of fights, shootouts and car chases, all of which are marvelous and exciting, and never degenerates into stupidity. The guns are still impeccably well-chosen and handled. Really cool. The new concept or two herein are very smart and well-thought out. The science fiction remains well-done. This holds an appropriate amount and volume of self-irony over the title character(though I did not mind the seriousness of the previous silver screen effort). While some of the dark tone is maintained, it is less violent and disturbing than the 1984 piece. There is also no nudity(well, just about) or sexuality in this. I have more points against this, meanwhile, they all give stuff away, and this will remain a spoiler-free review. And even with them, it's hard to argue with the quality of this, even if you prefer The Terminator to it(and I do). I recommend this to any fan of sci-fi, intense scenes, James Cameron, the others who made this, and/or food for thought wrapped neatly in celluloid. 10/10"

I don't know what you think but I think it's still better than all those Mission Impossible's action sequences. And those are great by the way. But this isn't great, this is just beyond great at Action sequences.Besides the great Action scenes with some revolutionary VFX, the storyline is just brilliant!James Cameron just written the best Time Travel story. I don't think I experienced any Time Travel movie like this. How can you assume that this time travel thing could be possible? This movie makes you question about it.When you're combine the whole story in your mind, you'll find one of the most brilliant storyline. It may feel like simple but I guarantee you, It's not at all. It's just too well written. Not only based on time travel of course. In my opinion after The Matrix, this is the second best AI Rebellion story."

            "Review": "I got to see The Dark Knight on Wednesday night, the reason though why I'm writing this movie comment this late is because I didn't wanna just jump and say this movie was awesome, I wanted to think it through, still today, I can't stop thinking about this movie! The Dark Knight lives up to it's hype and goes beyond it, this is the Batman movie that goes where no other Batman movie has gone before. It gave us a real sold story, we are finally told why the villains are the way they are, how all the injustice in the world can get underneath Batman's skin, how you have to believe that people still have faith in good on Earth. Heath Ledger, I absolutely loved Jack Nicolson's performance in the 1989 film, when I first read that Heath was signed onto The Dark Knight, I was like \"What are they, kidding?\", once you see The Dark Knight... Heath was incredible! I'm not going to compare Jack and Heath's performance, because they were two different versions of the Joker, but Heath's Joker was definitely the more scary and intense of the two nominations. You didn't know what he was going to do next, he was so crazy, he was also so charismatic to the point where you could relate to his character, and the worst part is not only that he's crazy, he's driving Gotham crazy and treating everyone like little puppets on strings that he can control, and guess what, he is doing it so well with a smile on his face. This was so much more than a Batman film, this was so much more than a comic book film, The Dark Knight truly delivers with drama, action, romance, horror, dark humor, the study of a psychopathic killer, a detective story. The force behind this epic movie is Christopher Nolan, who's previous film, Batman Begins, didn't really thrill me, but his incredible film making is truly shown in The Dark Knight, the shots that he got of Gotham City were absolutely fantastic and made you feel part of the city, part of the Batman story. One of the things that I absolutely loved about The Dark Knight is that normally with a comic book movie, you know it's not real, people don't dress up in costumes, and save the day, villains don't name themselves crazy names and dress in make up or crazy costumes, but The Dark Knight actually makes it seem incredibly real, like it could happen.Bruce Wayne is still learning how to be in his double life of Batman and himself, he has lost Rachel to the new district attorney, Harvey Dent, he's inspiring others who are dressing up as Batman and are trying to take on the villains of the city themselves. But things are much worse when the Joker waltzes into town, and he's going to bring Hell upon Gotham City. Constantly playing with Gotham's mind and trying to get Batman to reveal himself, Batman has never dealt with such a psychopathic genius before. The Joker has named himself as the \"Classy Villain that Gotham needs\", he also has brought a new thought into Batman's head of them actually being more alike than different, that Batman completes him, the Joker would be nothing without him. But Batman is relying on Harvey Dent, who is Gotham's \"White Knight\" trying to put all of Gotham's scum in jail. But when the Joker plays Batman and Commissioner Gordon, Harvey and Rachel find themselves in very horrific position and Harvey must discover if he will die a hero or live long enough to become a villain.All the performances are dead on in this movie, now everyone's going crazy over Heath Ledger's performance, but one performance I would also love to credit is Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent/Two Face, his performance was just as great as Heath's and made Two Face a human villain. You could understand his hatred and vengeance on what happened to him and why he became Two Face. I know that everyone is saying this but I truly mean when I say this is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. We had some great movies these past few years, but I think The Dark Knight is seriously something special, but I don't wanna build it up too much since some people go to the theater expecting my words to be the same as your own. In my opinion though this is not a great movie, I can't come up with a word describe how incredibly powerful this movie was, to be honest I would go above a 10 rating if I could; this is the Batman film that we have been waiting for. I've seen it twice in one weekend, I'm going to see it three times this upcoming week, I don't mind one bit. I can't wait for the sequel and I would just like to say RIP to Heath, wish he could have seen his breath taking performance as The Joker.10/10"

I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. \"The Dark Knight\" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!"

And it was my first movie in an IMAX theatre. I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it, even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre, this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.The movie could also have been called \"The Joker\", but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And \"The Dark Knight\" is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote. This is the best Batman movie ever (until hopefully Nolan and Bale make the next one)!"

That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn't enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we'll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. \"The Dark Knight\" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want."

            "Review": "I think that I could wax lyrical but this movie all day. It is absolutely incredible from start to finish.This is the Batman trilogy's second outing. It's filled with hard-hitting action and almost every scene is absolutely enthralling to watch. The story is really good. The twists and turns keep the viewer constantly on their toes, especially in the third act of the movie. There are so many memorable scenes packed throughout this movie, so many quotes and ideas sprinkled throughout that you probably could analyze it for hours.Because while the action and story is incredible, it is the dynamic between the Batman and the Joker that really makes this movie what it is. It is all in the contrast between the two. Right against wrong. Chaos and anarchy versus order. The Joker is the perfect villain for Batman. Batman is literally, as said in the movie, a symbol. The very essence of the idea of the Batman is centered around order, rules and moral codes. He is the embodyment of what is right. The Joker challenges the very core and foundation of who Batman is and what he stands for. He is someone who doesn't follow any rules. He is pure chaos and anarchy personified. As he so perfectly states in the third act of the movie, while hanging upside down off of a building: \"this is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object\". The Joker wants the Batman to go against his morals and to break his rules. The powerful thing is also that you can see why the Joker does what he does. In some ways he has a point and that also adds another layer to the character and to the dynamic between the two. It is truly an amazing battle. The brilliant acting from Heath Ledger is a major part of it too. He is absolutely incredible as the Joker. Rest in peace.I could probably go on further about how great I think this movie is but I'll just say this. Just watch the movie. You should watch the first movie of the trilogy first but if that is something you absolutely don't wan't to do I still think you should see this movie. It is just great."

            "Review": "Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy \"The Dark Knight\" EXCEEDED all  of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman  franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it,  amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more  gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times  throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to  fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if  his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his  fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the  help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael  Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But  the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly  enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack  Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker.  He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY  disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime  and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original  cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal  and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a  much better performance and is a far cry from the \"damsel-in-distress\"  stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in  films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around  more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly  improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than \"Begins\"  in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal.  Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the  film an added frosting to an already delicious cake.  Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than \"Begins.\" The  action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud  Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who  sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing  in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may  feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I  will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor  him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a  human being and father to his daughter Matilda  Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his  daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this  role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented  actor.  Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008."

            "Review": "Although I don't think it is the fourth best movie ever made, as it is rated according to IMDb, I do think it stands head and shoulders above its super-hero peers, mainly because it is NOT a superhero movie. Batman is a mere mortal with lots of time to train himself physically and money to design the nifty gadgets he uses.Everybody on earth has seen this film, so no use regurgitating the plot. I think Heath Ledger's rendition of The Joker is a masterpiece. Every time he leaves the screen I keep waiting for him to come back. Ledger should have won the best actor Oscar rather than supporting actor, because this is really a two leading man film - Bale as Batman and Ledger as The Joker. I always liked Jack Nicholson's rendition of the Joker in the 1989 film directed by Tim Burton, but Ledger just blows Nicholson's performance away. Maybe it is because Nicholson's Joker had a past and an explanation for his behavior, maybe it is because, after all, Nicholson's Joker just seems to be the wild side of the real Jack Nicholson where Heath Ledger never steps out of character for the entire film. Ledger's Joker is like the devil decides to become incarnate, but unlike Ray Milland's devil in \"Alias Nick Beal\" shows his true self - somebody who wants to break the spirits of people, to turn them on one another, to wantonly destroy property, people, whatever. That's reinforced when the police can find no name, no past, no prints, no DNA, not even a label in his clothes when they arrest him. His past is a great big question mark. I like Michael Caine's Alfred - it's good to have someone with relevant past combat and guerrilla experience be a wise father figure to Wayne in this role rather than just a kindly museum piece. Likewise, Morgan Freeman is pitch perfect as Lucius and Wayne's version of Q - somebody who invents his gadgets and runs his business since this really is not where Wayne's mind is, Freeman gives the performance the perfect balance of humor, business acumen, and conscience. And finally I like the fact that Rachel, Bruce Wayne's love interest, is not played by someone who is some unrealistic 10.5/10. She's a cute girl, but her attributes lie in her mind and her heart as well.The negatives - I think Harvey's transformation into Two Face is a little too pat. I don't know why Batman has a totally different voice from Bruce Wayne. Is he doing that on purpose? And I think I found one editing error. Gordon in the end talks about how hard it will be to cover up Harvey/ Two Face's murders including \"two cops\". Harvey let crooked cop Ramirez live and just knocked her out. But if she had lived then Gordon and Batman's plan to cover up Harvey's crimes would never have worked because she would have known what happened. So which scene was wrongly included/scripted? I'd recommend it as one of the better films made since the turn of the century that was also a blockbuster."

            "Review": "I think the big question...or the question everyone actually cares about is this: Is Christopher Nolan's follow up to the critically acclaimed 2005 film \"Batman Begins,\" The Dark Knight, as good as everyone is saying? Quite simply, yes, yes it is. There is no doubt about it, one of the most anticipated movies of the 21st century duly deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it. This is no ordinary superhero movie, this is a character and dialogue driven piece, not as action orientated as you might expect.I will not go into plot details, because there is a lot of it. However, a basic one sentence summary is: Batman now has to face his most cunning and psychotic enemy, someone with no real motives...The Joker. Now that that is out of the way, I will start off with the actors (and boy, is there a lot to talk about). Christian Bale has done a tremendous job as our beloved Caped Crusader, with him already blowing everyone else out of water with \"Batman Begins.\" Bruce Wayne has a flawed personality that hangs on the balance between righteousness and criminal. His perception of justice causes an emotional and personal shift, whether he is a wealthy businessman who fights crime in a gadget-riddled suit or just a normal man who is sick of all the scum in Gotham City and decides to give the law-breakers a dose of their own medicine. Because of this, and Bale's tremendous acting, Bruce Wayne is justified, and we emphasise with Bale's flawed hero more than any of the other actors. If there ever was an excellent Batman, this is it. The theme of right and wrong is played well with his character here.Of course, I am sure you all want know if Heath Ledger was that good. And I can safely say that he most definitely was. Ledger's Joker is not only the best, but is now the greatest superhero film villain ever. His performance is truly terrifying, chilling, brilliant; any synonyms of the previous adjectives. Every scene he is in is stolen. The Joker truly is Batman's worst villain; cunning and psychotic, nothing quite matches his laugh and sinister makeup. If Ledger nabs the Oscar for Best Actor, I honestly will not be surprised. It is a true tragedy to see such a talented actor fall at such a young age...All the other actors cannot be forgotten, though. Aaron Eckhart has definitely proved himself previously (\"Thankyou for Smoking\") as someone to watch out for. Here, as Harvey Dent (and later Two Face) he is very powerful. All he wants is justice; to bring down every single criminal. Eckhart is the definitive Two Face. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Wayne and Dent's love interest, Rachel Dawes is much better than Katie Holmes. Gyllenhaal's performance has substance, I really cared for her and her future and she was terrific in every scene. Michael Caine can do no wrong, and as Alfred Pennyworth he provides some comical and emotional scenes. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, although a limited role, does inject some sly humour and much needed morals into the story. Finally, Gary Oldman's Lt. James Gordon is riveting. He at least needs a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance as another crime-fighting hero who faces some challenging situations.Wally Pfister's cinematography is simply stunning. Gotham has never looked so good, so big and deep. His wide shots purvey a dirty aura and contribute to the feel of the film. Without it, it may not have been the same. Another Oscar worthy portion, THE MUSIC! With Hans Zimmer AND James Newton Howard at the helm, how could it go wrong? The score sets the mood in every scene, giving an epic and thrilling tone. During the action sequences it really ups the adrenaline. And on the topic of action, The Dark Knight succeeds in having the best fight sequences and car chases in a comic book adaptation yet. With no obvious or over-use of CGI, the explosions and accidents are the real deal. Thrilling, edge of your seat and violent, this is brutally awesome stuff.Nevertheless, none of this would be possible without Christopher Nolan, the man behind it all. Pairing up with the writer (and brother) Jonathon Nolan, the darkest Batman movie yet is the best, and the best so far this year. This does not feel like a comic book film, the dialogue and situations feel so realistic. And, it IS the script that drives this film. The dialogue is very, very well written and is the centre of the conflict and the movie.It may be bold to say this, but this is the best superhero film of all time. There are others that are magnificent (\"Superman\" and \"X-Men\" are two examples) but this is the most complex, the most dark and the most spectacular and epic of them all. See it for Bale, for Ledger, for the music, the action and for Nolan's flawless direction.5/5 and the best film of 2008 so far!!"

It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating. Heath Ledger makes this movie great. And it surpasses the series reboot 'Batman Begins'."

            "Review": "So it finally happened, a DC Comics movie adaptation that out-marveled the Marvel folks, and to such a degree that it might be quite a while before anything comes close to topping \"The Dark Knight\". This was the severely grim and gritty version of the Batman, ushered in by Frank Miller's initial treatment in the landmark graphic novel \"The Dark Knight Returns\" in 1986. Miller's portrayal of the iconic super hero took the gloves off as far as politically correct behavior goes. The movie explores this theme at many levels, and would have served up enough of a plot to keep this viewer interested even without the explosions, chases and general mayhem that modern day audiences need to get their fix on. Actually, the Joker summed it all up quite brilliantly hanging upside down from one of Batman's cables over the streets of Gotham, as noted in my summary line above. In the comic book world, they HAVE been fighting each other forever, or as long as forever exists since the creation of Batman back in 1939; the Joker came on the scene in 1940 in the comic, Batman #1.I don't think this could have been the same picture without Heath Ledger in the role of Batman's all time greatest nemesis. His portrayal blows away Jack Nicholson's performance in 1989's \"Batman\", and that's through no fault of Nicholson's. Today's films are a product of harsher and deadlier times, and it's striking that Ledger's characterization would define the Joker as an extremist, perhaps even a terrorist. More than once I found myself questioning what was going on during the opening bank robbery scene. The bad guys were offing each other based on instructions delivered by the Joker, and you suddenly come to the realization that this domino game had to end with one man standing. It's how we're introduced to Ledger's definitive Joker, a performance that won't be topped.Another thought came to me as I watched the story unfold, and that was how similar the coin toss gimmick paralleled the one in \"No Country For Old Men\". Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) began using the tactic following the death of Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), and I began picturing Javier Bardem in the role of The Joker. Hard to imagine who might have been the more evil character, Bardem's Anton Chigurh in a more realistic setting, or The Joker in a fictional Gotham City. Fortunately, not a choice one would normally have to consider.I'm a little bit on the fence as to Christian Bale's portrayal of The Batman. He's more than adequate as Bruce Wayne, but the voice he gives to the Dark Knight seems a bit melodramatic. Granted, he couldn't use the same voice as his alter ego, but there were times that it sounded so forced as to come across as parody, and other times just goofy, almost a throwback to the Adam West days of the TV Batman. Strange, but have you considered that no one ever calls him the Caped Crusader anymore either?All in all, great performances all around. Gary Oldman's portrayal of the new Commissioner Gordon was excellent, while Michael Caine as Alfred, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox were solid even with limited screen time. I thought about Katie Holmes just once while making a mental comparison when Maggie Gyllenhaal first appeared on screen. Truthfully, they looked similar enough to effect the transition smoothly to the point where it wasn't distracting for me in the least.Obviously, the set up for the next sequel was firmly set in place with the creation of Two Face, the now alter ego of District Attorney Harvey Dent. The rendering of Dent's burned face was boldly executed and quite marvelous in it's own grotesque way. I'll be looking forward to the next installment.And NOW, for a personal rant. I probably should put this in parentheses because it doesn't have anything to do with the movie, but for this picture to be #1 on the IMDb list of all time best movies after 4 days of release is incomprehensible, if not downright laughable (and I did rate it a 10 myself). I think there should be a moratorium of at least a couple of years before a film qualifies for IMDb ranking, giving the dust some time to settle from all the grand opening hoopla that surrounds a picture like this. I feel the same way about other recent movies like \"No Country For Old Men\" and \"There Will Be Blood\", both of which garnered numerous awards and fan approval. But if they're to be considered among the best films of all time, they'll be considered that way a decade from now without the need for multiple votes from over zealous fan boys."

            "Review": "(Synopsis) Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) continues to eliminate crime in Gotham City with the help of Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the new District Attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). The Dark Knight wants to finally get rid of organized crime for good and be free of their corruption. Batman soon finds that a new psychopathic mastermind known as the Joker (Heath Ledger) has taken over organized crime. The Joker's plan is to terrify the citizens and throw the city into chaos, and kill Batman. Batman takes the fight with the Joker personal, which makes him confront his own beliefs. The Joker is the most dangerous criminal that Batman has encountered, and he will need all his strength and vigilance to defeat him.(My Comment) This film just blew me away. Christian Bale is a natural as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and Michael Caine fits the part of Alfred, the trusted butler. Heath Ledger's performance as the sadistic Joker was absolutely disturbing and scary yet simply amazing. I would not want to meet the Joker in a dark alley, and whatever you do, don't ask him how he got his smile, especially, when he has a knife in his hand. Ledger's performance has turned the Joker into a new iconic movie villain image. Between all the punches, mayhem, and explosions, there is some good sinister dialog. The movie not only has a lot of action, it also tells the story of the internal struggle that Bruce Wayne is having with being the Batman hero. Bruce Wayne wants to be himself and maintain the difference between himself and Batman. Bruce must decide to follow the code or do what has to be done without affecting his own morals. The movie explores the literary themes of Hero verses Villain, as well as Order verses Anarchy, and the Joker explains to Batman that to have one you must have the other, and because of that, they will always be connected. The movie is long, but it went by so fast. You will love the last 45 minutes, because of the non-stop action with Batman in his new sonic suit and his BatPod. With all the explosions, body count, and the dark mood of the movie, I don't think parents should take young children. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Run Time 2:32, Rated PG-13)(10/10)"

            "Review": "Batman has always been my favourite superhero ever since the first time I heard about him because he his human with no powers, also he is much more questionable than any other superhero. The story of the film is about Batman, Lieutenant James Gordon, and new district attorney Harvey Dent beginning to succeed in rounding up the criminals that plague Gotham City. They are unexpectedly challenged when a mysterious criminal mastermind known as the Joker appears in Gotham. Batman's struggle against the Joker becomes deeply personal, forcing him to \"confront everything he believes\" and to improve his technology (which introduces the recreation of the Batcycle, known as the Batpod and the Batsuit was redesigned) to stop the madman's campaign of destruction. During the course of the film, a love triangle develops between Bruce Wayne, Dent and Rachel Dawes.There are now six Batman films and I must say that The Dark Knight is the best out of all of them. The title is good because that is what Batman actually is. It has been 3 years for the adventure to continue from Batman Begins but that entire wait was worth it. Gotham city is very Gothic looking and is very haunting and visionary. The whole movie is charged with pulse-pounding suspense, ingenious special effects and riveting performances from a first-rate cast especially from Heath Ledger who gave an Oscar nomination performance for best supporting-actor. It is a shame that he can't see his terrific work on-screen. The cinematography is excellent which is made so dark & sinister that really did suit the mood for the film. Usually sequels don't turn out to be better than the original but The Dark Knight is one of those rare sequels that surpasses the original like The Godfather 2. I also really liked the poster where the building is on fire in a Bat symbol & Batman is standing in front of it. Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director and his film Memento is one of my most favourite films. He hasn't made 10 movies yet and 3 of them are already on the IMDb top 250. Overall The Dark Knight is the kind of movie that will make the audience cheer in the end instead of throwing fruit & vegetables on the screen."

            "Review": "This Is probably the second best sequel of all time, second only to the return of the king. I've seen this movie twice in cinema this year, that's just how good it is. I could name very few flaws in this movie. This movie has some of the best preformances of all time. Heath ledgers preformance is nothing short of phenomenal and arguably the best preformance we've ever been given in a superhero film. However I believe Aaron eckhart plays his role as two-face to perfection which is severely overshadowed by Heath ledgers. Definitely one of those movies you can watch numerous times. Christopher nolan is a brilliant director 10/10."

            "Review": "I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel \"Star Wars\" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for \"Dark Knight\".Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, \"Dark Knight\" ably stands on its own with or without \"Batman Begins\". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the \"Batman\" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in \"Batman Forever\", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.\"The Dark Knight\" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars."

            "Review": "I thought Batman Begins was a very well conceived and put together  movie. We finally get Batman as a fully rendered character. We gain new  insight into his motivations and the variables he must contend with in  his role as protector of Gotham. We get to see Gary Oldman as an  honest-to-goodness good guy. And we get to see Liam Neeson conducting  perhaps his strangest facial hair experiment yet.  But after seeing The Dark Knight, Batman Begins will forevermore be  viewed (by me at least) as a handy little prologue to a FRICKIN'  MASTERPIECE of a superhero film.  To say it's the deepest mainstream comic adaptation ever produced would  be akin to calling the Nolan/Ledger Joker 'a bit eccentric'.  While watching it, I found myself thinking it was very long, which is  usually a sign that it's TOO long, and therefore boring. But that's not  actually the case here. The script is bulging with ideas, philosophical  musings, THEMES, which Christopher Nolan is not content to gloss over  in favour of cool set-pieces (as many comic adaptations are), but wants  to explore, wants to allow the characters to explore, at a logical  pace. So, what I guess I'm saying is, considering what it sets out to  do, the movie is long ENOUGH, while still constantly holding the  viewer's interest.  And that's not to say the thematic exploration comes at the EXPENSE of  big action, either. On the contrary, there is some truly awesome stuff  going on here. The chase with the truck, for example, is fantastic, and  there's some great hand-to-hand stuff too.  But what engages us most is the characters, and, while the script is  brilliant (the dialogue is sharp, and quite funny for the first  two-thirds, before the drama really kicks in), this mainly comes down  to the cast.  Christian Bale. Taller than Michael Keaton was. More menacing than Val  Kilmer was. Less like Adam West than George Clooney was. Solid and  committed as always. He gives the character LIFE, and actually makes us  feel for him. The word 'tortured' keeps coming to mind...and I suppose  it's pretty appropriate.  Heath Ledger. Y'know, I'd heard talk of an Oscar nomination, and  thought it sounded a bit dubious. A Batman villain? Winning an Oscar?  Is that what it's come to? Then I thought, is it because he didn't get  one for Brokeback? Or more dubious still...is it because he...died?  But...well...how can I put it...?   It seems a bit blasphemous to compare Jack Nicholson to Cesar Romero,  but after seeing Heath at work...Jack (who once seemed so awesome) just  looks...well...lame.  If you've seen it, you hopefully get what I mean. If you haven't...you  need to. You will discover the true definition of commitment.  Maggie Gyllenhaal. I didn't have any problem with Katie in the first  one (at the time), but I doubt she could have pulled off the more  emotional stuff Rachel goes through here. Seeing recasting was  necessary (does Tom have a problem with his wife being involved with  Batman? Too many bad memories perhaps? Why am I even talking about such  garbage here?) they could have done a butt-load worse than Maggie. She  rocks.  As does Aaron Eckhart. But I'm not giving ANYTHING away. Suffice it to  say my mind was blown...AGAIN. Makes Tommy Lee Jones look like...you  get the idea.  Michael Caine. Still one of my favourite actors. Alfred is the shiz.  Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman. AOK.  Gary Oldman. As in BB, no mania. No psychosis. No nervous tics.  Absolute subtlety. Manages to hold his own alongside Christian, Heath  and Aaron without resorting to parlour tricks. Sign of spectacular  talent. Go Gaz.  Eric Roberts! William Fichtner! Michael Jai White! Tiny Lister!  The whole thing is just a big bag of thoughtful, well-executed  entertainment. It's equal parts cerebral and visceral. Ideas and  action.  I've liked every Batman movie so far (okay, besides Batman & Robin),  but this one makes them all look pretty bloody ordinary."

            "Review": "I got to see The Dark Knight on Wednesday night, the reason though why I'm writing this movie comment this late is because I didn't wanna just jump and say this movie was awesome, I wanted to think it through, still today, I can't stop thinking about this movie! The Dark Knight lives up to it's hype and goes beyond it, this is the Batman movie that goes where no other Batman movie has gone before. It gave us a real sold story, we are finally told why the villains are the way they are, how all the injustice in the world can get underneath Batman's skin, how you have to believe that people still have faith in good on Earth. Heath Ledger, I absolutely loved Jack Nicolson's performance in the 1989 film, when I first read that Heath was signed onto The Dark Knight, I was like \"What are they, kidding?\", once you see The Dark Knight... Heath was incredible! I'm not going to compare Jack and Heath's performance, because they were two different versions of the Joker, but Heath's Joker was definitely the more scary and intense of the two nominations. You didn't know what he was going to do next, he was so crazy, he was also so charismatic to the point where you could relate to his character, and the worst part is not only that he's crazy, he's driving Gotham crazy and treating everyone like little puppets on strings that he can control, and guess what, he is doing it so well with a smile on his face. This was so much more than a Batman film, this was so much more than a comic book film, The Dark Knight truly delivers with drama, action, romance, horror, dark humor, the study of a psychopathic killer, a detective story. The force behind this epic movie is Christopher Nolan, who's previous film, Batman Begins, didn't really thrill me, but his incredible film making is truly shown in The Dark Knight, the shots that he got of Gotham City were absolutely fantastic and made you feel part of the city, part of the Batman story. One of the things that I absolutely loved about The Dark Knight is that normally with a comic book movie, you know it's not real, people don't dress up in costumes, and save the day, villains don't name themselves crazy names and dress in make up or crazy costumes, but The Dark Knight actually makes it seem incredibly real, like it could happen.Bruce Wayne is still learning how to be in his double life of Batman and himself, he has lost Rachel to the new district attorney, Harvey Dent, he's inspiring others who are dressing up as Batman and are trying to take on the villains of the city themselves. But things are much worse when the Joker waltzes into town, and he's going to bring Hell upon Gotham City. Constantly playing with Gotham's mind and trying to get Batman to reveal himself, Batman has never dealt with such a psychopathic genius before. The Joker has named himself as the \"Classy Villain that Gotham needs\", he also has brought a new thought into Batman's head of them actually being more alike than different, that Batman completes him, the Joker would be nothing without him. But Batman is relying on Harvey Dent, who is Gotham's \"White Knight\" trying to put all of Gotham's scum in jail. But when the Joker plays Batman and Commissioner Gordon, Harvey and Rachel find themselves in very horrific position and Harvey must discover if he will die a hero or live long enough to become a villain.All the performances are dead on in this movie, now everyone's going crazy over Heath Ledger's performance, but one performance I would also love to credit is Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent/Two Face, his performance was just as great as Heath's and made Two Face a human villain. You could understand his hatred and vengeance on what happened to him and why he became Two Face. I know that everyone is saying this but I truly mean when I say this is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. We had some great movies these past few years, but I think The Dark Knight is seriously something special, but I don't wanna build it up too much since some people go to the theater expecting my words to be the same as your own. In my opinion though this is not a great movie, I can't come up with a word describe how incredibly powerful this movie was, to be honest I would go above a 10 rating if I could; this is the Batman film that we have been waiting for. I've seen it twice in one weekend, I'm going to see it three times this upcoming week, I don't mind one bit. I can't wait for the sequel and I would just like to say RIP to Heath, wish he could have seen his breath taking performance as The Joker.10/10"

I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. \"The Dark Knight\" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!"

And it was my first movie in an IMAX theatre. I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it, even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre, this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.The movie could also have been called \"The Joker\", but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And \"The Dark Knight\" is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote. This is the best Batman movie ever (until hopefully Nolan and Bale make the next one)!"

            "Review": "I think that I could wax lyrical but this movie all day. It is absolutely incredible from start to finish.This is the Batman trilogy's second outing. It's filled with hard-hitting action and almost every scene is absolutely enthralling to watch. The story is really good. The twists and turns keep the viewer constantly on their toes, especially in the third act of the movie. There are so many memorable scenes packed throughout this movie, so many quotes and ideas sprinkled throughout that you probably could analyze it for hours.Because while the action and story is incredible, it is the dynamic between the Batman and the Joker that really makes this movie what it is. It is all in the contrast between the two. Right against wrong. Chaos and anarchy versus order. The Joker is the perfect villain for Batman. Batman is literally, as said in the movie, a symbol. The very essence of the idea of the Batman is centered around order, rules and moral codes. He is the embodyment of what is right. The Joker challenges the very core and foundation of who Batman is and what he stands for. He is someone who doesn't follow any rules. He is pure chaos and anarchy personified. As he so perfectly states in the third act of the movie, while hanging upside down off of a building: \"this is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object\". The Joker wants the Batman to go against his morals and to break his rules. The powerful thing is also that you can see why the Joker does what he does. In some ways he has a point and that also adds another layer to the character and to the dynamic between the two. It is truly an amazing battle. The brilliant acting from Heath Ledger is a major part of it too. He is absolutely incredible as the Joker. Rest in peace.I could probably go on further about how great I think this movie is but I'll just say this. Just watch the movie. You should watch the first movie of the trilogy first but if that is something you absolutely don't wan't to do I still think you should see this movie. It is just great."

            "Review": "Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy \"The Dark Knight\" EXCEEDED all  of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman  franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it,  amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more  gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times  throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to  fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if  his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his  fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the  help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael  Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But  the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly  enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack  Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker.  He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY  disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime  and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original  cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal  and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a  much better performance and is a far cry from the \"damsel-in-distress\"  stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in  films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around  more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly  improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than \"Begins\"  in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal.  Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the  film an added frosting to an already delicious cake.  Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than \"Begins.\" The  action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud  Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who  sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing  in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may  feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I  will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor  him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a  human being and father to his daughter Matilda  Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his  daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this  role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented  actor.  Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008."

            "Review": "Although I don't think it is the fourth best movie ever made, as it is rated according to IMDb, I do think it stands head and shoulders above its super-hero peers, mainly because it is NOT a superhero movie. Batman is a mere mortal with lots of time to train himself physically and money to design the nifty gadgets he uses.Everybody on earth has seen this film, so no use regurgitating the plot. I think Heath Ledger's rendition of The Joker is a masterpiece. Every time he leaves the screen I keep waiting for him to come back. Ledger should have won the best actor Oscar rather than supporting actor, because this is really a two leading man film - Bale as Batman and Ledger as The Joker. I always liked Jack Nicholson's rendition of the Joker in the 1989 film directed by Tim Burton, but Ledger just blows Nicholson's performance away. Maybe it is because Nicholson's Joker had a past and an explanation for his behavior, maybe it is because, after all, Nicholson's Joker just seems to be the wild side of the real Jack Nicholson where Heath Ledger never steps out of character for the entire film. Ledger's Joker is like the devil decides to become incarnate, but unlike Ray Milland's devil in \"Alias Nick Beal\" shows his true self - somebody who wants to break the spirits of people, to turn them on one another, to wantonly destroy property, people, whatever. That's reinforced when the police can find no name, no past, no prints, no DNA, not even a label in his clothes when they arrest him. His past is a great big question mark. I like Michael Caine's Alfred - it's good to have someone with relevant past combat and guerrilla experience be a wise father figure to Wayne in this role rather than just a kindly museum piece. Likewise, Morgan Freeman is pitch perfect as Lucius and Wayne's version of Q - somebody who invents his gadgets and runs his business since this really is not where Wayne's mind is, Freeman gives the performance the perfect balance of humor, business acumen, and conscience. And finally I like the fact that Rachel, Bruce Wayne's love interest, is not played by someone who is some unrealistic 10.5/10. She's a cute girl, but her attributes lie in her mind and her heart as well.The negatives - I think Harvey's transformation into Two Face is a little too pat. I don't know why Batman has a totally different voice from Bruce Wayne. Is he doing that on purpose? And I think I found one editing error. Gordon in the end talks about how hard it will be to cover up Harvey/ Two Face's murders including \"two cops\". Harvey let crooked cop Ramirez live and just knocked her out. But if she had lived then Gordon and Batman's plan to cover up Harvey's crimes would never have worked because she would have known what happened. So which scene was wrongly included/scripted? I'd recommend it as one of the better films made since the turn of the century that was also a blockbuster."

            "Review": "I think the big question...or the question everyone actually cares about is this: Is Christopher Nolan's follow up to the critically acclaimed 2005 film \"Batman Begins,\" The Dark Knight, as good as everyone is saying? Quite simply, yes, yes it is. There is no doubt about it, one of the most anticipated movies of the 21st century duly deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it. This is no ordinary superhero movie, this is a character and dialogue driven piece, not as action orientated as you might expect.I will not go into plot details, because there is a lot of it. However, a basic one sentence summary is: Batman now has to face his most cunning and psychotic enemy, someone with no real motives...The Joker. Now that that is out of the way, I will start off with the actors (and boy, is there a lot to talk about). Christian Bale has done a tremendous job as our beloved Caped Crusader, with him already blowing everyone else out of water with \"Batman Begins.\" Bruce Wayne has a flawed personality that hangs on the balance between righteousness and criminal. His perception of justice causes an emotional and personal shift, whether he is a wealthy businessman who fights crime in a gadget-riddled suit or just a normal man who is sick of all the scum in Gotham City and decides to give the law-breakers a dose of their own medicine. Because of this, and Bale's tremendous acting, Bruce Wayne is justified, and we emphasise with Bale's flawed hero more than any of the other actors. If there ever was an excellent Batman, this is it. The theme of right and wrong is played well with his character here.Of course, I am sure you all want know if Heath Ledger was that good. And I can safely say that he most definitely was. Ledger's Joker is not only the best, but is now the greatest superhero film villain ever. His performance is truly terrifying, chilling, brilliant; any synonyms of the previous adjectives. Every scene he is in is stolen. The Joker truly is Batman's worst villain; cunning and psychotic, nothing quite matches his laugh and sinister makeup. If Ledger nabs the Oscar for Best Actor, I honestly will not be surprised. It is a true tragedy to see such a talented actor fall at such a young age...All the other actors cannot be forgotten, though. Aaron Eckhart has definitely proved himself previously (\"Thankyou for Smoking\") as someone to watch out for. Here, as Harvey Dent (and later Two Face) he is very powerful. All he wants is justice; to bring down every single criminal. Eckhart is the definitive Two Face. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Wayne and Dent's love interest, Rachel Dawes is much better than Katie Holmes. Gyllenhaal's performance has substance, I really cared for her and her future and she was terrific in every scene. Michael Caine can do no wrong, and as Alfred Pennyworth he provides some comical and emotional scenes. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, although a limited role, does inject some sly humour and much needed morals into the story. Finally, Gary Oldman's Lt. James Gordon is riveting. He at least needs a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance as another crime-fighting hero who faces some challenging situations.Wally Pfister's cinematography is simply stunning. Gotham has never looked so good, so big and deep. His wide shots purvey a dirty aura and contribute to the feel of the film. Without it, it may not have been the same. Another Oscar worthy portion, THE MUSIC! With Hans Zimmer AND James Newton Howard at the helm, how could it go wrong? The score sets the mood in every scene, giving an epic and thrilling tone. During the action sequences it really ups the adrenaline. And on the topic of action, The Dark Knight succeeds in having the best fight sequences and car chases in a comic book adaptation yet. With no obvious or over-use of CGI, the explosions and accidents are the real deal. Thrilling, edge of your seat and violent, this is brutally awesome stuff.Nevertheless, none of this would be possible without Christopher Nolan, the man behind it all. Pairing up with the writer (and brother) Jonathon Nolan, the darkest Batman movie yet is the best, and the best so far this year. This does not feel like a comic book film, the dialogue and situations feel so realistic. And, it IS the script that drives this film. The dialogue is very, very well written and is the centre of the conflict and the movie.It may be bold to say this, but this is the best superhero film of all time. There are others that are magnificent (\"Superman\" and \"X-Men\" are two examples) but this is the most complex, the most dark and the most spectacular and epic of them all. See it for Bale, for Ledger, for the music, the action and for Nolan's flawless direction.5/5 and the best film of 2008 so far!!"

However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize Gotham.Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart adds a good performance as Harvey Dent. In the end, this is Heath Ledger's movie. He overpowers everybody. His early death may have immortalized him, but my opinion isn't inflated. His presence is electric. It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating. Heath Ledger makes this movie great. And it surpasses the series reboot 'Batman Begins'."

            "Review": "So it finally happened, a DC Comics movie adaptation that out-marveled the Marvel folks, and to such a degree that it might be quite a while before anything comes close to topping \"The Dark Knight\". This was the severely grim and gritty version of the Batman, ushered in by Frank Miller's initial treatment in the landmark graphic novel \"The Dark Knight Returns\" in 1986. Miller's portrayal of the iconic super hero took the gloves off as far as politically correct behavior goes. The movie explores this theme at many levels, and would have served up enough of a plot to keep this viewer interested even without the explosions, chases and general mayhem that modern day audiences need to get their fix on. Actually, the Joker summed it all up quite brilliantly hanging upside down from one of Batman's cables over the streets of Gotham, as noted in my summary line above. In the comic book world, they HAVE been fighting each other forever, or as long as forever exists since the creation of Batman back in 1939; the Joker came on the scene in 1940 in the comic, Batman #1.I don't think this could have been the same picture without Heath Ledger in the role of Batman's all time greatest nemesis. His portrayal blows away Jack Nicholson's performance in 1989's \"Batman\", and that's through no fault of Nicholson's. Today's films are a product of harsher and deadlier times, and it's striking that Ledger's characterization would define the Joker as an extremist, perhaps even a terrorist. More than once I found myself questioning what was going on during the opening bank robbery scene. The bad guys were offing each other based on instructions delivered by the Joker, and you suddenly come to the realization that this domino game had to end with one man standing. It's how we're introduced to Ledger's definitive Joker, a performance that won't be topped.Another thought came to me as I watched the story unfold, and that was how similar the coin toss gimmick paralleled the one in \"No Country For Old Men\". Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) began using the tactic following the death of Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), and I began picturing Javier Bardem in the role of The Joker. Hard to imagine who might have been the more evil character, Bardem's Anton Chigurh in a more realistic setting, or The Joker in a fictional Gotham City. Fortunately, not a choice one would normally have to consider.I'm a little bit on the fence as to Christian Bale's portrayal of The Batman. He's more than adequate as Bruce Wayne, but the voice he gives to the Dark Knight seems a bit melodramatic. Granted, he couldn't use the same voice as his alter ego, but there were times that it sounded so forced as to come across as parody, and other times just goofy, almost a throwback to the Adam West days of the TV Batman. Strange, but have you considered that no one ever calls him the Caped Crusader anymore either?All in all, great performances all around. Gary Oldman's portrayal of the new Commissioner Gordon was excellent, while Michael Caine as Alfred, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox were solid even with limited screen time. I thought about Katie Holmes just once while making a mental comparison when Maggie Gyllenhaal first appeared on screen. Truthfully, they looked similar enough to effect the transition smoothly to the point where it wasn't distracting for me in the least.Obviously, the set up for the next sequel was firmly set in place with the creation of Two Face, the now alter ego of District Attorney Harvey Dent. The rendering of Dent's burned face was boldly executed and quite marvelous in it's own grotesque way. I'll be looking forward to the next installment.And NOW, for a personal rant. I probably should put this in parentheses because it doesn't have anything to do with the movie, but for this picture to be #1 on the IMDb list of all time best movies after 4 days of release is incomprehensible, if not downright laughable (and I did rate it a 10 myself). I think there should be a moratorium of at least a couple of years before a film qualifies for IMDb ranking, giving the dust some time to settle from all the grand opening hoopla that surrounds a picture like this. I feel the same way about other recent movies like \"No Country For Old Men\" and \"There Will Be Blood\", both of which garnered numerous awards and fan approval. But if they're to be considered among the best films of all time, they'll be considered that way a decade from now without the need for multiple votes from over zealous fan boys."

            "Review": "(Synopsis) Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) continues to eliminate crime in Gotham City with the help of Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the new District Attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). The Dark Knight wants to finally get rid of organized crime for good and be free of their corruption. Batman soon finds that a new psychopathic mastermind known as the Joker (Heath Ledger) has taken over organized crime. The Joker's plan is to terrify the citizens and throw the city into chaos, and kill Batman. Batman takes the fight with the Joker personal, which makes him confront his own beliefs. The Joker is the most dangerous criminal that Batman has encountered, and he will need all his strength and vigilance to defeat him.(My Comment) This film just blew me away. Christian Bale is a natural as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and Michael Caine fits the part of Alfred, the trusted butler. Heath Ledger's performance as the sadistic Joker was absolutely disturbing and scary yet simply amazing. I would not want to meet the Joker in a dark alley, and whatever you do, don't ask him how he got his smile, especially, when he has a knife in his hand. Ledger's performance has turned the Joker into a new iconic movie villain image. Between all the punches, mayhem, and explosions, there is some good sinister dialog. The movie not only has a lot of action, it also tells the story of the internal struggle that Bruce Wayne is having with being the Batman hero. Bruce Wayne wants to be himself and maintain the difference between himself and Batman. Bruce must decide to follow the code or do what has to be done without affecting his own morals. The movie explores the literary themes of Hero verses Villain, as well as Order verses Anarchy, and the Joker explains to Batman that to have one you must have the other, and because of that, they will always be connected. The movie is long, but it went by so fast. You will love the last 45 minutes, because of the non-stop action with Batman in his new sonic suit and his BatPod. With all the explosions, body count, and the dark mood of the movie, I don't think parents should take young children. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Run Time 2:32, Rated PG-13)(10/10)"

            "Review": "Batman has always been my favourite superhero ever since the first time I heard about him because he his human with no powers, also he is much more questionable than any other superhero. The story of the film is about Batman, Lieutenant James Gordon, and new district attorney Harvey Dent beginning to succeed in rounding up the criminals that plague Gotham City. They are unexpectedly challenged when a mysterious criminal mastermind known as the Joker appears in Gotham. Batman's struggle against the Joker becomes deeply personal, forcing him to \"confront everything he believes\" and to improve his technology (which introduces the recreation of the Batcycle, known as the Batpod and the Batsuit was redesigned) to stop the madman's campaign of destruction. During the course of the film, a love triangle develops between Bruce Wayne, Dent and Rachel Dawes.There are now six Batman films and I must say that The Dark Knight is the best out of all of them. The title is good because that is what Batman actually is. It has been 3 years for the adventure to continue from Batman Begins but that entire wait was worth it. Gotham city is very Gothic looking and is very haunting and visionary. The whole movie is charged with pulse-pounding suspense, ingenious special effects and riveting performances from a first-rate cast especially from Heath Ledger who gave an Oscar nomination performance for best supporting-actor. It is a shame that he can't see his terrific work on-screen. The cinematography is excellent which is made so dark & sinister that really did suit the mood for the film. Usually sequels don't turn out to be better than the original but The Dark Knight is one of those rare sequels that surpasses the original like The Godfather 2. I also really liked the poster where the building is on fire in a Bat symbol & Batman is standing in front of it. Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director and his film Memento is one of my most favourite films. He hasn't made 10 movies yet and 3 of them are already on the IMDb top 250. Overall The Dark Knight is the kind of movie that will make the audience cheer in the end instead of throwing fruit & vegetables on the screen."

Heath ledgers preformance is nothing short of phenomenal and arguably the best preformance we've ever been given in a superhero film.

            "Review": "I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel \"Star Wars\" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for \"Dark Knight\".Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, \"Dark Knight\" ably stands on its own with or without \"Batman Begins\". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the \"Batman\" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in \"Batman Forever\", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.\"The Dark Knight\" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars."

            "Review": "I thought Batman Begins was a very well conceived and put together  movie. We finally get Batman as a fully rendered character. We gain new  insight into his motivations and the variables he must contend with in  his role as protector of Gotham. We get to see Gary Oldman as an  honest-to-goodness good guy. And we get to see Liam Neeson conducting  perhaps his strangest facial hair experiment yet.  But after seeing The Dark Knight, Batman Begins will forevermore be  viewed (by me at least) as a handy little prologue to a FRICKIN'  MASTERPIECE of a superhero film.  To say it's the deepest mainstream comic adaptation ever produced would  be akin to calling the Nolan/Ledger Joker 'a bit eccentric'.  While watching it, I found myself thinking it was very long, which is  usually a sign that it's TOO long, and therefore boring. But that's not  actually the case here. The script is bulging with ideas, philosophical  musings, THEMES, which Christopher Nolan is not content to gloss over  in favour of cool set-pieces (as many comic adaptations are), but wants  to explore, wants to allow the characters to explore, at a logical  pace. So, what I guess I'm saying is, considering what it sets out to  do, the movie is long ENOUGH, while still constantly holding the  viewer's interest.  And that's not to say the thematic exploration comes at the EXPENSE of  big action, either. On the contrary, there is some truly awesome stuff  going on here. The chase with the truck, for example, is fantastic, and  there's some great hand-to-hand stuff too.  But what engages us most is the characters, and, while the script is  brilliant (the dialogue is sharp, and quite funny for the first  two-thirds, before the drama really kicks in), this mainly comes down  to the cast.  Christian Bale. Taller than Michael Keaton was. More menacing than Val  Kilmer was. Less like Adam West than George Clooney was. Solid and  committed as always. He gives the character LIFE, and actually makes us  feel for him. The word 'tortured' keeps coming to mind...and I suppose  it's pretty appropriate.  Heath Ledger. Y'know, I'd heard talk of an Oscar nomination, and  thought it sounded a bit dubious. A Batman villain? Winning an Oscar?  Is that what it's come to? Then I thought, is it because he didn't get  one for Brokeback? Or more dubious still...is it because he...died?  But...well...how can I put it...?   It seems a bit blasphemous to compare Jack Nicholson to Cesar Romero,  but after seeing Heath at work...Jack (who once seemed so awesome) just  looks...well...lame.  If you've seen it, you hopefully get what I mean. If you haven't...you  need to. You will discover the true definition of commitment.  Maggie Gyllenhaal. I didn't have any problem with Katie in the first  one (at the time), but I doubt she could have pulled off the more  emotional stuff Rachel goes through here. Seeing recasting was  necessary (does Tom have a problem with his wife being involved with  Batman? Too many bad memories perhaps? Why am I even talking about such  garbage here?) they could have done a butt-load worse than Maggie. She  rocks.  As does Aaron Eckhart. But I'm not giving ANYTHING away. Suffice it to  say my mind was blown...AGAIN. Makes Tommy Lee Jones look like...you  get the idea.  Michael Caine. Still one of my favourite actors. Alfred is the shiz.  Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman. AOK.  Gary Oldman. As in BB, no mania. No psychosis. No nervous tics.  Absolute subtlety. Manages to hold his own alongside Christian, Heath  and Aaron without resorting to parlour tricks. Sign of spectacular  talent. Go Gaz.  Eric Roberts! William Fichtner! Michael Jai White! Tiny Lister!  The whole thing is just a big bag of thoughtful, well-executed  entertainment. It's equal parts cerebral and visceral. Ideas and  action.  I've liked every Batman movie so far (okay, besides Batman & Robin),  but this one makes them all look pretty bloody ordinary."

            "Review": "It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather\". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. \"Citizen Kane\" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did \"Gone With the Wind\" or \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". \"The Godfather\" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement."

I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest, 10/10."

            "Review": "Tell me a movie that is more famous than this. Tell me a movie that has had more parodies spinned off its storyline than this. Tell me one movie that has been as quoted as a much as this. The answer is you can't. No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a clich\u00e9. His performance though was not a clich\u00e9. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.The horse's head, the scene of Brando running with his groceries, the coffee shop scene, \"I'll give him an offer he can't refuse\" and countless other scenes and quotes from this movie have become a part of our culture. These scenes and lines have been recycled over and over again in comedies, commercials, etc. that it is impossible to avoid the greatness of The Godfather. The Godfather is like a disease once you see it you fall in love with it. I don't know if it is the greatest movie ever but it is definitely the most iconic film ever made."

            "Review": "The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for \"gangster movies\", but its influence goes well beyond that.The Godfather's influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every \"organized crime film\" nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's imagination.But to say that The Godfather is simply \"influential\" is to diminish its true qualities, and so is to describe it simply as \"a movie about gangsters\". The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around (despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear different from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors' performances had in the cinematic triumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a slip. The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other roles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him: although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time, everybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in the last few years.The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don's power extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely popular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer, Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger people working in the crime business, Don Corleone's ideas are becoming obsolete. The Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up self-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye. Drugs are another thing.To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don Corleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see Michael Corleone, Vito's younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business, lose his \"innocence\" and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against.I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and -- believe it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible.There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an expos\u00e9 of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra's real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people. I won't go into that: frankly, I have no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra reference seems obviously quite believable.The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends."

So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.My advice is that instead of just watching \"The Godfather\" and \"The Godfather: Part II\", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience."

            "Review": "There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox"

            "Review": "This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability."

            "Review": "THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all."

            "Review": "Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint."

            "Review": "\"The Godfather\" simply put, is one of the greatest films of all time. The script is thee best I've ever read. The direction is flawless. The acting may very well have the best ensemble cast in any movie I've ever seen or will ever see. It's also one of the most precise and intricate films I've ever come across as writer, Mario Puzo brings out some of the most hidden and guarded secrets of the underground world ever captured on film. Watching \"The Godfather,\" is like watching cinematic art. Francis Ford Coppola's direction is what brings this film, that's so ambitious and so grand, down to earth with precision direction as he handles each and every scene with such care. The film starts with a black screen and an opening monologue from an undertaker. As the man starts talking about honor, family, respect, and justice we are pulled right in on his luminous eyes as he stands in near darkness. He begs for justice since the American system has failed him. He goes to Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) for justice. Don Vito is the man of power. He's the one who pulls all the strings and watches his puppets dance from behind the stage and out of sight; untouchable, or so we think. Some of the greatest moments in the film- and very intentional to show the distinguishable difference between Michael and Vito- are of Vito crying over his son, Sonny's (James Caan), death. When Michael learns of the news, he has little reaction. Two of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the film are from the cause of a loved one that has died long before he should have, and they come from Brando. As Vito stands over the body of his son he nearly breaks down. There is clash of feelings between the two men that are never conflicting, but compared. The film opens during the wedding of Don Vito' daughter, Connie (Talia Shire), and we see just how strong the bond of family really is. You have the family dancing with each other, drinking, laughing, and sitting next to each other to show how close they are, then we see some of the outsiders such as the Barzini family, and surprisingly Michael (Al Pacino) along with his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) on the outskirts without much interaction. Michael seems almost out of place as if he is the adopted son and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is more apart of the family than he is. His opening words are to Kay, and they include, \"That's my family, Kay. That's not me.\" We get the feeling that Michael's nearly ashamed of the stigma that goes along with his last name: This is what makes Al Pacino' role- significantly- the hardest performance in the entire film to portray. He's the one doing all the heavy lifting as he has to go from outsider and completely against the family's actions and businesses to, by films end, head of the family. Brando has the teary eyed moments that actors live for, but Michael is too cold for that. Never for a second as he gradually comes to power do we think this turn is ridiculous or laughable, and in lesser hands it very easily could have been. The final act of the film is loaded with plot points as decisions are made left and right as the film becomes visually and emotionally captivating. As the film draws to an end, Michael has gained half of the power of the family and makes most of the decisions. He's treated, not with respect, but as an outsider, too high ranking for his experience. The Corleone family is on the brink of disaster and losing everything, yet we never get that feeling. We see the two leader's confidence and we keep our confidence in them, even if the other family members doubt their decisions. Michael goes to Las Vegas and makes Moe Greene an offer he can't refuse. Then he refuses. This is Pacino' shinning moment in the film. There's no screaming or the hoopla that goes along with his name. After he treats Moe Greene like utter garbage, Fredo (John Cazale) get's upset and starts barking at him. Coppola is perfectly on his game here, too, as we watch from Fredo's height, looking down on Michael who sits in a chair as he coldly looks up with his radiating eyes, that have so much going on behind them, and simply says, \"Fredo, don't ever take sides with anyone against family again. Ever.\"That's some serious foreshadowing for the second film, and only after watching the second film can you go back and appreciate what Pacino and Coppola pulled off in this scene; Cazale too. We have no idea how serious Michael is. These are some of the stepping stones that make Michael's change believable. He's not quite his father- Vito has a soft spot for his children (admittedly so)- as he's capable of turning on anyone and using the line, \"It's strictly business\" when it comes to family issues. Michael's sister, Connie, calls him a \"cold hearted bastard\" at the end of the film. It's hard to find better superlatives than that, yet we still love him. The interesting thing about Pacino' performance is that he doesn't sugarcoat it. He doesn't try to make the audience love him. He plays the character as the character should be played. That's the sign of great writing; great acting; and great directing since we could have very easily seen someone try to make him likable. This crew just presents the character with all his flaws and let's us decide if we love him or hate him. Its films like \"The Godfather,\" that made me wish I had amnesia, so I could feel the same heart pounding moments over and over again."

Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses.

            "Review": "You can't really criticize a film like \"The Godfather\", especially from a younger-type guy like me. Since its release in 1972, \"The Godfather\" has been highly praised by fans universally. It's extremely hard for a person who has never seen \"The Godfather\" without having high expectations because millions of people, maybe more have been talking about how wonderful it is. But as a film critic who has seen the movie several times and has read the novel that it was based on by Mario Puzo, this movie really deserves the credibility it gets. It really is that special. The film is a gripping epic that indulges the viewer with plenty of unsuspecting twists and a plot that works in a multitude of dimensions. The mobster's depicted here face many trials and tribulation that involve marriage, favours, family struggles, turncoats, tragic events, violence and rigor mortis.Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head patriarch and kingpin of his esteemed enterprise is acquainted to at his daughter's wedding, which is a special occurrence in Italian tradition (Sicilian in particular) where the father of the bride is to refrain from offering the groom any special favours. His representatives showing their signs of respect towards the Don are featured in the opening scenes are told through their ways of personal address and greeting regimentations. The Don is to be treated with respect and dignity, a man who follows his own frame of mind to what is fair, and will likely deny any means of avenge. As an example, if anyone was to fondle with his daughter in any kind of way grounds for murder. It's not revenge, as long as your daughter's still breathing.There are also numerous facets that indicate how not so respected the Don really is. Vito comes from the old school of Mafia, and can be labeled as a \"Moustache\" Pete. For one, unlike his adversaries, he refuses to get involved with drugs or smuggling for that matter. It this is much to the chagrin of other rival mob units in the state of New York. The violence is described disturbingly as nothing personal, it's just business. The philosophy behind this organized crime is chilling, but quite convincing. The violence is creepily accepted and sometimes happens all of the sudden. Suddenly, the Corleone enterprise falls on its foundations, and it's up to the next generation to restore the family so it could be ranked as the top of the best mob families.The cast features a myriad of talented performers each playing their respective roles flawlessly. The top stars like Brando as Vito, James Caan as the hot-tempered Sonny, Al Pacino as the likable Michael, John Cazale as middle-sibling Fredo, Robert Duvall as mob attorney Tom Hagen, Richard Castellano as Clemenza, Abe Vigoda as Tessio and Diane Keaton as Kay Adams are what I may have expected what the characters from Puzo's book look like physically. Even the smaller roles deserve special credit. The performances were absolutely amazing. The characters in the film compliment the characters from the novel and it is mainly due to the physical structuring and the carefully planned interpretation.The novel this movie was based on by Mario Puzo deserves praise in itself. Even though this movie was a fictional, there are a lot of authentic features that make every scene and every chapter to be real. I guess people when they think of mob bosses they visualize a supreme Don, sitting in his chair with a long facial expression contemplating with endless level-headedness and leadership. \"The Godfather\" is a marvel from both the film and the novel and it is hard to determine what medium is the better of the two.If there is one thing that the book is better would be character development. Al Pacino's Michael Corleone is a more prominent character in the novel than in the movie. Michael's transformation in the movie is at times a bit rushed, while in the book it's handled more gradual. The other character Luca Brasi played by Lenny Montana was a more vital character in the novel, which while he was an ally to the Corleone clan, is marked as a threatening adversary with a dark and dreary secret. In the movie comes across as a big oaf, and not as scary. It's also nice that some of the smaller characters from the novel have engaging back stories like Captain McCluskey (Sterling Hayden). But that's good for the novel's sake, while the film would result in overdone detailing.Overall, \"The Godfather\" is one of the greatest films ever made. Thanks mainly to the crew for creating a well-structured setting that compliments nicely to the characters, the script and most importantly, the direction of Francis Ford Coppola. Hats off to the cinematography from Gordon Willis which is backed nicely by the elegant score from Nino Rota and Carlo Savina. This film truly defines the words \"required viewings.\""

            "Review": "It's basically impossible to watch this movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola, without already knowing some of the major themes, motifs, plot twists, within author Mario Puzo's story; due to how popular the film is. Even, if you haven't saw the movie, you probably heard of it. If you had, saw it. You might agree with me, in scope, that this movie is indeed, one of the greatest films ever made. Based off, Mario Puzo's 1969 novel with the same name, The Godfather tells the story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) on his journey, from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss, during the criminal drug wars of the 1940/early 1950s. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found that a lot of critics, overpraise Marlon Brando's work in this, a way too much. Don't get me wrong, Marlon Brando does deserve, a lot of credit for making his character, the patriarch Vito Corleone, so iconic. I just don't believe, that he deserve, the Oscar for Best Actor, that year. In my opinion, Al Pacino should had be nominated & won. After all, Michael is pretty much, the main character, not Vito. Also, Pacino is the one actor that kept the movie, going, with his great range of emotional. Brando show-what disappears, toward the middle of the film. If any, Brando deserve to win, Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards, because Brando's acting is secondary to that of Pacino. It's not personality, it's only business. Besides that, the acting throughout the film was well-performed, from all the actors. I just wish, there wasn't much, many characters. It was so hard to keep track of each one. Some actors, worth noting for their performance are James Caan as Michael's hot-headed brother, Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as Irish lawyer, Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Michael's girlfriend, Kay Adams & last, John Cazale as Michael's weaker brother, Fredo Corleone. As much, as I despise, certain gangster films. There was something, likable with these characters. Yes, they do, horrible stuff, but you can't help, feeling bad for them. Indeed, keep your friends close, your enemies closer. Not only was the film had gifted actors, but it was very well-shot. I love, how the film used doors, as a way to symbolize, the different between family life, and 'the family life'. A great example of this, was the last few minutes of the film in which Kay finds out, the truth nature about Michael. It's a crucial theme of the film. The five families are essentially living the American dream with specific ideals that America at the time greatly treasured. One could easily see this as a deconstruction or even an attack on the idea of the American Dream. So it was no surprise that the families met inside a Federal Reserve Bank. Talk about smart! I also like, how the movie has this stark bleak look to it. All the colors in the film, looks so muted, as if to say, this gangster film was indeed shot in early 1940s, technicolor. I like how, clever, the filmmaker was, when using bright colors. Most of the only bright color, used in the film, was orange. It was used as mostly an item, like a fruit symbol. It representing sin, and greed. It's as if it was the forbidden fruit, in the bible. It was also, used as a sexual way to show impending judgment. Everybody that got near it, end up, dying in the film. While, the movie has tons of other symbolism. It's also shroud in darkness and mystery. The movie even has a few film noir inspire scenes, where shadow, become a big factor to show, how shady, the underworld, can be. Vito's daughter's wedding scene shows the best of this. The movie has a lot of violence as well. Scenes like the real horse severed head were pretty gruesome. Still, compare to modern day, gangster movies, the sex, drugs and violence is pretty tame. For the most part, the movie kept to a somewhat classy mode with its subject matter. I do like the editing. The whole baptize sequence was amazing to watch. The pacing for the film is a mixed bag for me. There were some parts of the film that I kinda found boring or out of place, such as the Sicily, Las Vegas & Hollywood scenes. It felt like, I was watching two different films, due to how unfamiliar, each of those scenes, were, when comparing to the New York settling. I just glad, they were very short. The film also drops a lot of the novel's subplots, such as Sonny's mistress, having a large vagina, and having to get surgery on it. Another thing worth cutting is a lot of Johnny Fontane (Al Martino) and Lucy Mancini (Jeannie Linero) scenes. In the novel they both get big story lines nearly the equal of the main storyline with Michael. I'm glad, they cut it out, because it was too jarring. Though one major one, they cut out in this film: Don Vito's youth and rise to power came back, as part of the sequel, 1974's the Godfather: Part II. Happy, that they found, a way to add that, back in. Leave the Fontane BS. Take the cannoli, instead. The film score by Nino Rota was great. You really think of the word 'mafia' when you hear that tune. While, the film doesn't deliberately speak that word, it did expose, what was then, a mostly hidden underworld of Mafia organizations. Overall: While, some big time criminals and even some stars, like Frank Sinatra were against it, and boycott the film, but they couldn't stop the movie, from being made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 40 years after its release. It's a classic."

            "Review": "Before 'The Godfather' came out in 1972, the gangster genre, chiefly associated with Jimmy Cagney and the film noir style of the forties and fifties, had been in something of a decline. It was, therefore, a brave move for Francis Ford Coppola to attempt a three-hour epic based upon the family life of a Mafia don. The film opens in the immediate post-war period with the wedding of the daughter of Don Vito Corleone. Scenes of the wedding are intercut with scenes showing Don Vito himself in his study, granting favours and dispensing a crude form of justice as though he were an absolute monarch. We soon learn, however, that times are changing, even in the world of organised crime. Don Vito's empire has been based upon gambling, illicit liquor sales and prostitution. Other Mafia families, however, are eager for the profits to be made from drugs, and Corleone receives a proposal from a drug dealer named Sollozzo that the Corleone clan should join him in exploiting the narcotics market. Corleone refuses, ostensibly for business reasons, but it is made clear that his real objections to narcotics derive from his personal code of honour. Sollozzo, offended, orders an attempt to be made on Corleone's life. This fails, but Corleone is left seriously injured.The focus now shifts to the younger generation. Don Vito has three sons, Santino ('Sonny'), Fredo and Michael, and an adopted son, Tom Hagen. These four have contrasting characters. Sonny is hot-headed and impetuous, Fredo weak, Tom cautious and moderate. Michael, the youngest, loves his family, but initially wants to play no part in their criminal enterprises. Recently returned from the war, his ambitions are to qualify as a lawyer and to settle down in a respectable life with his Anglo-Saxon wife-to-be, Kay. The attempt on his father's life, however, persuades Michael that his first loyalty is to the family, and he agrees to be part of a revenge attack on Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey the corrupt policeman who is on his payroll. There follows a brutal cycle of revenge, as each killing is avenged by another murder. The film's emphasis on family ties, honour and vengeance recall the revengers' tragedies of the Shakespearean and Jacobean theatre. Coppola does seem to be aiming for a Shakespearean grandeur. Don Vito, the ageing monarch whose powers slip away is reminiscent of King Lear, Michael, a good man corrupted by power, of Macbeth (a comparison which will become even more apt in the later episodes of the trilogy). There is also something of Hamlet in Michael and Sonny's resolve to avenge their father. Such an ambitious film requires acting of a very high order if it is to seem credible, but Coppola was able to draw upon some of the best performances of the seventies. To my mind, this was Marlon Brando's last great role (I have never cared much for 'Apocalypse Now' and loathed 'Last Tango in Paris'), but it was one that he made the most of. His Don Vito is both terrifying and pitiable, part dictator and part lonely old man. His rasping voice (the result of an earlier bullet wound in the throat) conveys both menace and physical weakness. Don Vito may be a bad man, but he is also in a way a magnificent one, and his passing marks the end of an era. If the film was notable for the last of the great Brando, it also saw the birth of a new star. Except perhaps for 'The Godfather Part II', I have never seen Al Pacino give a better performance than he did here, as he portrayed Michael's passage from a 'civilian' (as his brother calls him) to a warlord, from an innocent young idealist to a ruthless killer. Given the length of time that Pacino is on screen, I am surprised that he was only nominated for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor. It would be interesting to speculate who might have won if he and Brando had been in competition for the award. I am even more surprised that Pacino did not win as Best Supporting Actor; Joel Grey's role in 'Cabaret' (which did win) is more showy and a technical tour de force, but it lacks the emotional depth of Pacino's performance. I also greatly admired James Caan's role as the hot-headed Sonny. This is not a perfect film; it has flaws, both artistic and ethical. Artistically, there are places where it tends to drag, particularly after the killings of Sollozzo and McCluskey, and even more so after the killing of Sonny, although it recovers at the ending, which is a highly effective piece of cinema. Ethically, I felt that the film tended to take the characters' world view too much at face value. Don Vito may be a dictator, but he is in his own eyes a benevolent dictator, a man of honour who lives by his own moral code. As others such as Roger Ebert have pointed out, this is a film which views a closed society from the inside; the only outsider is Kay, and her role is a relatively minor one. As a result, we do not get to see the damage that organised crime does to the fabric of society, and the Mafia's own view of itself is never openly challenged. That is not to say, however, that the film is totally amoral. We do see that an ethos of taking revenge can spiral out of control and lead to unforeseen consequences, to the innocent as well as the guilty. This is particularly true of the scenes where Michael takes refuge in Sicily after killing Sollozzo. The dead man's associates track him down, and a bomb meant for him instead kills his innocent young Italian wife Apollonia. Although there may be no overt condemnation of the moral position of the Mafia, there is implied criticism of its bloodier deeds. All the characters, whatever the crimes of which they may be guilty, are careful to pay lip-service to the Catholic Church and its rituals. Throughout the film (indeed, throughout the trilogy as a whole) the traditional ceremonies of the Church form a backdrop to various criminal activities. ('The Godfather' begins with a wedding and ends with a baptism). It seemed to me that Coppola was using these scenes to make an ironic contrast between the values of organised crime and those of Christianity, especially at the end of the film. Michael, already a 'godfather' in the metaphorical sense of a Mafia boss, becomes one in the literal sense of a baptismal sponsor. Shots of him taking vows on behalf of his godchild to reject the works of the devil are intercut with shots of his enemies being gunned down on his orders.Despite my reservations about this film, and although I personally would not have ranked it as my all-time favourite, there can be no denying that it is a film of great power and a milestone in the history of the cinema. 8/10"

I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film."

            "Review": "The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a clich\u00e9. His performance though was not a clich\u00e9. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get."

            "Review": "This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants. The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.Do not miss this film!"

            "Review": "My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation. All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando's adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an \"offer he can't refuse\", or \"Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes\" is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it's beautifully played.In fact it's all beautifully played."

            "Review": "The world is teeming with wretched prisons wherein all manner of men are housed. Because these men are said to have committed a crime, the places are manifest and most men serving there, have earned their stay. However, as history has shown, there are innocent men incarcerated as well. Occasionally, one of these innocents are not only imprisoned, but are further remembered because their life becomes legend. In this case, the realization is nothing short of incredible as the new prisoner is a natural empath. Steven King the prolific American horror writer, chronicles this unusual story in a Louisanna prison where one Joe Coffee, (Michael Clarke Duncan) a huge, nay, enormous Black man, having been convicted of murder, is sentenced to be executed, by electrocution. Tom Hanks( And Dabbs Greer) plays Paul Edgecomb, an aging Prison Guard, who recalls his years in the state prison. Working on 'Death Row' or \" The Green Mile \", Mr. Edgecomb recalls Mr. Coffee's arrival and the strange events during his stay. With sympathetic Guards, like Brutus Howell (David Morse), Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper), Harry Terwilliger (Jeffery Demunn and one particular sadistic guard called Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison), Edgecomb recollects his discovery of the man's unusual healing powers and the surprising revelations concerning his innocence. The story is crafted by Steven King and it's application to the silver screen is perhaps one of the finest adaptation ever done. Duncan is magnificent and has a superb ability to allow the audience to learn his true purpose. Were it not for the sadistic behavior of Hutchison, who earned his ultimate reward, the story would not have carried it's genuine sympathetic awe which gave this movie it's Classic status. A great film and a must for true movie fans. ****"

            "Review": "THE GREEN MILE (1999) ****Starring: Tom Hanks, David Morse, Michael Clarke Duncan, Bonnie Hunt, James Cromwell, Michael Jeter, Doug Hutchison, and Gary Sinise Written and directed by Frank Darabont. Running Time: 180 minutes. Rated R (for scenes of strong disturbing violence, language, and some sexuality)By Blake French:It's not everyday that a movie is able to change an audiences opinion on something. \"The Green Mile\" is a movie that made me think long and hard about supporting the death penalty. The film, based on a novel by Stephen King, contains such a variety of emotional events that it repels its audience away from its subject rather than glamorizing it. Only a handful of recent productions have been capable of such power. \"The Green Mile\" is truly one of the best films this year and is Oscar Worthy in many categories. It is a unique, three hour experience that must be seen to believe.The story is more of a personal narrative than an actual plot. The film offers an interesting perspective of the events that take place. It is seen through the eyes of a man who is over one hundred years of age, Paul Edgecomb, who is currently living in an old folks home with his friend, Elaine. During a very emotional day for Paul, he tells Elaine of a historical year in his experiences. She listens closely to his story.He tells of a particular year in the 1930's. The setting is a beautifully crafted prison hall. Paul explains he used to be a kind prison guard on death row in charge of overseeing the executions. In this year, several significant activities occurred in his life: he had a terribly painful urinary infection, and met a prisoner named John Coffey. This man has been sentenced to the electric chair for the rape and murder of two innocent little girls. This man isn't like anyone else Paul has seen, however. Aside from being massive in size, he is humble, mild mannered, and caring. After several miraculous events take place that may point to the thought that John Coffey might have magical powers from God, Paul begins to doubt the crimes this so called criminal has been convicted of.Throughout the story we witness three executions that in an electric chair. These capital punishment sequences have much power and significance. The electrocutions, one in particular, contain some of the most unsettling, disturbing material in film history. The movie is anti death penalty; we see the sometimes sadistic world from the prisoner guards point of view. It will put you in their shoes--and perhaps, change your opinion on the death penalty. I certainly had to think about my stand on this issue.I did have questions that were not really answered by the filmmakers. I wanted more on John Coffey's magical powers; the miracles aren't investigated enough to suit our pleas. I think the movie could have also stood on a firmer platform of religion. We assume that Coffey's abilities are a gift from God from the character's dialogue, but religion itself is more of a theme in the film than a message or plot point. I can perfectly see why the writers decided to leave these elements to the audiences imagination, to provoke participation. So I suppose my objections are not really flaws, just personal aspirations.\"The Green Mile\" contains so many vivid performances, I will not be able to honor everyone who deserves credit in my review. Michael Jeter, Gary Sinise, Doug Hutchison, James Cromwell, Bonnie Hunt, and David Morse are all superior in strength of their characters. Each contributes Oscar worthy performances, and if the Academy leaves these individuals out at Award time, they need to recheck their databases. Michael Clarke Duncan recently received a Golden Globe nomination for his supporting role, and he deserves it. Tom Hanks is just unspeakably brilliant in the leading role. He is right behind Kevin Spacey from \"American Beauty\" in the best performance of 1999.The message to \"The Green Mile\" is clear and understandable: justice isn't always just and the miracles can happen in the most unexpected of places. This film is one of the most penetrating dramas of the past several years. It will induce your mind to think about its subjects, and gradually build on you. \"The Green Mile\" is a movie that will stick with you long after the ending credits role by.Brought to you by Warner Bros."

            "Review": "I'm glad that a number of reviewers have informed me that this highly unusual tale was a faithful adaption from the novel by Stephen King. I'm not much of a fiction reader so it is gratifying to hear that his vision got to the screen intact. I would not have guessed this film would have come from a horror story writer. No monsters from the id or any place else are present in this story set in the American South of the Thirties. But demons do exist in The Green Mile and there is a man named John Coffey who takes them unto himself.The Green Mile refers to the cell block housing the inmates scheduled for Death Row. In that cell block comes Michael Clarke Duncan who is close to seven feet tall and maybe weighing 400 pounds. He's also as docile as a baby lamb and whose only request is that they leave a night light burning because he gets a little afraid of a strange place in the dark.Of course the guards who have the typical white Alabama attitudes of the day don't quite know what to make of them, but Tom Hanks who captains the cell block and most of the rest find out just how special he is. And Hanks cannot believe that someone like Duncan could possibly be guilty of a double rape/murder of a child.This modern day parable of the Jesus story has King telling us that it is very possible that many of his kind have walked the earth with talents for healing. One of them got a religion worked around him, but they can come in all walks of life and certainly no one would expect one to come in the guise of an illiterate black Alabama sharecropper. But one of my favorite Bible verses has Jesus himself saying that what you do unto the least of my brethren you do unto me.Somebody of Michael Clarke Duncan's size and build is not going to get too many really good roles and he certainly hasn't played anything remotely like John Coffey again. Parts like that don't come along and the film seems almost to have been built around him. It's one of the most moving performance that has ever been put on film in history. And it's an incredibly difficult role, he's meek for his size and Uncle Tom like, but as we learn far from it. In fact Coffey is beyond what the ordinary human mind can comprehend. Duncan received one of four Academy Award nominations that The Green Mile got, in his case for Best Supporting Actor. Since the film is built around him, my only question is why was it the Supporting Actor category?The Green Mile was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Sound and Best Adapted Screenplay, but did not come home a winner in any of these. A pity that one of the best films of the Nineties could not get at least one Oscar.Where there's a Christ-like figure you also have some devil spawn villains and we have a pair of them in Sam Rockwell as another death row prisoner and David Hutchison as a rat of a prison guard with both connections and issues. What happens to them is both poetic and diabolical in true Stephen King tradition. Others in the cast of note are Bonnie Hunt as Mrs. Hanks, James Cromwell and Patricia Clarkson as the warden and his wife, David Morse and Barry Pepper as two other guards on the block and Michael Jeter as another prisoner with a remarkably trained 'circus' mouse.The Green Mile is a remarkable allegorical picture and might be considered for Easter time viewing if it has a season. It certainly will make folks think."

I would argue so, twenty odd years on, and I am still captivated by the magic of The Green Mile.Not many films get me, this one always does, it's an incredibly moving film, one of those films where you will need your hankies for a few scenes. Many scenes hit hard throughout, some moving, some disturbing, there really is a richness to its content that is quite something.Plenty of outstanding scenes, I've always enjoyed that moment where the guards are first introduced to John, that scene towards the end though, (we all know which one,) that is such an incredibly powerful moment.Tom Hanks gives an outstanding performance, as indeed do the whole cast.The accompanying music works so well, the score enhances the film.It's quite a long film, but it's one of those will just fly by, you'll be so engrossed you won't even notice the hours ticking by.10/10."

If there is anything in this world which reminds me of true human love and compassion, it is this film.

He is Paul Edgecomb; Tom Hanks is nowhere to be found.  Yet he gives Edgecomb just the right flavor.  One cannot find a single weak cast member!  Michael Jeter should have got an Oscar.  Michael Clark Duncan put just the right shading on his huge character to make him vulnerable and sympathetic.Flawlessly shot on perfect period sets, the whole production binds together to bring the extraordinary story into the realm of a believable and compelling study of human injustice and charity."

This wasn't the first time he directed one of those adaptations. He proved that with The Shawshank Redemption.The storyline is just too effective and great! Not only the storyline is good, the timeline order is the real key. If this movie was on chronological order, the movie would be half effective.Also the great chosen cast with so iconic performances makes the movie even more effective. Especially the brilliant performance by Michael Clarke Duncan.Cinematography is also quite amazing. I think we can see that in especially in the forest scenes and the rainy scene.I think Original Scores could be better. It's good when you're watching the movie but the Scores are not meant for listening after the movie. The Prestige has the similiar scores in my opinion. Not the type of the Scores are similar but they're not that iconic to listen. At least it was like that for me."

            "Review": "Frank Darabont returns to the directors chair with another adaptation of Stephen Kings novel. The events take place at a death row, the guards call the green mile. The story is a layered, rather character-driven fantasy tale of the events that transpire at \"the mile\" after the arrival of a giant man, John Coffey (Michael Duncan), convicted of the murder of two small girls. Actually this is not one single story, but several tied together seamlessly.A character-driven movie requires a lot from the cast, and fortunately when it comes to cast, The Green Mile delivers. As the poster of the movie tells, this movie stars Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, senior prison guard of the mile, and as always he performs very well indeed. Yet the cast around him is even more spectacular, perhaps partially due to them being relatively unknown. With a face you know, one inevitably remembers previous performances, and the new role is coloured by this.  Doug Hutchison as Percy Wetmore, a mean spirited prison guard was particularly impressive, yet his character could have been given more depth. The most captivating was the performance of Michael Duncan.It is hard to find a flaw in this movie. The camerawork is superb, cast wonderful and direction flawless. The movie's considerable length, a bit over three hours, is something that had me worried. Yet the marvellous cast and the peaceful yet firm pace of the movie held my attention progressively through the three hours right to the touching culmination. Many will find this movie to be too long, but I for one was delighted of the style, combination of simplicity of events and depth of characters and conversation.All in all the The Green Mile is a very touching drama, with the joys and sorrows of the life pictured with great skill, if not the best movie of the year. Five out of five."

            "Review": "\"The Green Mile\" is one of my favorite Stephen King books and I have read it several times.  I was anxiously anticipating the film version, but was concerned that the emotional impact of the book could not be replicated on screen.  Fortunately this wonderful story was adapted by Frank Darabont, who did such a magnificent job bringing King's \"Shawshank Redemption\" to the screen.  He does the same high quality work with \"The Green Mile\".  The story is faithful to the book, only losing details that were not important to the story anyway.  The casting is superb - every actor is perfectly suited for his role and does an excellent job, although I would like to single out Doug Hutchison.  His portrayal of the detestable Percy is right on the mark and suggests complexities in this character I had not discovered in the book.  The length is about three hours and it seems that critics are complaining about that.  I can't understand the complaints.  The film never drags and is never dull, and it certainly didn't feel three hours long.  The length is needed to tell this story the way it should be told, and the story is so very engrossing.  Best of all, Darabont and the actors bring so much emotion ot the screen, that I cried like a baby through several scenes. \"The Green Mile\" will haunt you."

            "Review": "There's a reason why this Oscar winning tour de force is #67 ranked of all films on IMDb, despite the fact that it's 3 hours long and has some truly grisly scenes (not for the squeamish, children, or a first date.)It's chock full of outstanding performances, not only from Hanks, but also from the many supporting characters, all who are rich and full. It will seem slow to the impatient, but will be richly rewarding for those with the stamina to make it to the end. It will certainly get you thinking about capital punishment and perhaps different shades/degrees of evil. It is either a deeply moving spiritual tale or a wonderfully creepy journey down the rabbit hole of Stephen King's mind; take your pick. Either way, I put it right up there on my desert island list with the likes of Shawshank Redemption. It is definitely required watching."

            "Review": "With this movie Tom Hanks proves why he is one of the all time best male actors that shook the world with their abnormal amazing acting roles. Among the TOP 100 IMDB rated movies, he has probably more than 4-5, including The Green Mile, Forest Gump and Saving Private Ryan, Captain Philips was also an amazing movie. But the spotlight in The Green Mile is reserved for Michael Clarke Duncan in the role of John Coffey. Nobody can count the amount of people that this person made cry in the early 2000's. He is the most adoring male human being that showed up on the movie screen in this century, his acting is out of this world and emotions are leaking out of every cell of his body. The fact that the actor died 7 years ago makes everyone 10 times more sad....rest in piece legend. Above all, we must not forget that this is another movie based on a Stephen King novel that succeded big time, which shows why we may consider King as the best novel writer of all time."

            "Review": "I went looking for an experience. Something that would take me to the limits of my own existence and remind me that even in the darkest corner of my own life, there was hope. I was reminded, instead that along with the triumph there must also be sacrifice. A part of me died in that theater, but I walked out feeling renewed, refreshed...and a little cursed.I think Paul Edgecomb feels the same way.Tom Hanks has to be the epitome of a Hollywood living legend...and the guy's only in his 40s. He went from scraping his way through sophomoric slap like The 'Burbs, Turner & Hooch, and Bachelor Party to rise up in the 90s as our towering \"everyman.\"  Anyone who marvels in his \"simple guy in complicated circumstances\" roles such as Forrest Gump and Saving Private Ryan knows that he can deliver the goods...and an Oscar nomination (or win...or two...in aROW!!!)  But Tom does something very interesting in The Green Mile.  He lays back.The breakout performance in this film goes to Michael Clark Duncan (right now tied with Sixth Sense's Haley Joel Osment for my Best Supporting Actor vote).  Crippled by his size, Mr. Duncan has a limit of the roles he can play. However, given the role of a child-like behemoth with Christ-like powers of healing, Duncan brings to the screen a performance that will transcend the Denzels and the Poitiers of the world.The Green Mile is Cell Block E in a Louisiana State Prison, death row. Paul Edgecomb run this wing with compassion, a startlingly different approach considering the legendary cruelty of southern prisons.  He is surrounded by men in him employ who all share his philosophy that these men ultimately await the most devastating punishment.  Why make their stay any more troubling.All save one: Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchinson), relative of the Governor and always ready to remind anyone who disagrees his HIS methods just who got him his job. Percy hates everything about The Green Mile; the prisoners, other guards, even a tiny, brave mouse who befriends one of the inmates (Michael Jeter).  It isn't until another new inmate is processed, a man they call \"Wild Bill\", that Percy will meet his equal.So where is the common thread? What is a messianic character doing on death row? What role will Tom Hanks play in his redemption? And what's this \"curse\" thing I brought up in the beginning of this review?If I could tell you, you wouldn't slap the money down on the box office and find it for yourself.  Let me just tell you that the final blessings bestowed by John Coffey (Duncan) could make optimists and pessimists alike find a common ground. How you perceive the final moments will be up to how you impart on yourself...and the world.If John Coffey guilty of his crime?  Are the fates of the characters in this film deserved?  Half and half.  Evil is punished, bu t goodness must bare witness...and that has a price as well.  Will Tom Hanks win another Academy Award?  He shouldn't.  Is this a good film?  No.  It's an incredible film.I still weep for Paul Edgecomb."

            "Review": "The Shawshank Redemption is possibly my favorite movie ever. I had seen many movies before it, and I've certainly seen a lot after, but not many of them made me feel what that one did. Now, I have that feeling again. And once again, it comes from watching a Frank Darabont movie. I couldn't possibly explain the overload of emotions I experienced in the 3 hours it lasts. I have laughed. I have felt the emotions of every character. And most of all, I have cried. Very few movies have touched me like this one. Is there something to say about the acting that hasn't been said before? No, it isn't. You may have heard it is flawless, incredible, whatever. You did hear right, it absolutely is. I can't think of anyone in the whole movie that wasn't convincing in the least. The script has its funny moments, but it's incredibly deep, poignant and heartfelt. The characters are so \"human\" and unpretentious you can't help but adore them. But, well, there will be some you'd like to strangle. There has to be a villain everywhere, right? The Green Mile is a movie I will hardly forget. You can't possibly forget such an emotive story.What, you want to watch it? Great! But don't forget to have grab some tissues first."

            "Review": "Until I saw 'the Green Mile', I always thought that the 'Shawshank Redemption' and 'Forrest Gump' were the two saddest movies that I ever saw, but this movie actually blew me away for good.'The Green Mile' tells the tale of a few prison officers whose life changes when a supposed rapist/murderer gets sent to the prison they are in. During this time, they come to realize that he has a mysterious power that can be used for good and that the man may truly be innocent of all accused crimes.I love every single thing about 'the Green Mile', the same way I loved everything about 'The Shawshank Redemption' and 'Forrest Gump'. The acting in the movie was just perfected on all corners. Tom Hanks brilliantly portrays the complex character of Paul Edgecomb and the late Michael Clarke Duncan absolutely steals the show in an Oscar robbed performance as John Coffey. May he ever rest in peace. It wasn't, however, just those two who gave strong performances. The actors playing Brutus, Hal, Del, Percy, Wharton all did an unbelievable job at portraying how realistic prison life may truly be.The story is so emotionally moving that it is impossible to not like and connect with. The characters presented in the movie are some of the finest movie characters that I've ever seen. This film truly mastered characters and what they undergo during prison life.The directing and writing by Frank Darabont, the man behind 'The Shawshank Redemption' absolutely masters everything a film needs to get right once more and adds such layers to each character that we come to truly love by the end of the film.The tone to the movie is so dark that we are immediately thrown into the world presented in this movie. The movie is so sad on many occasions that I was truly left bawling my eyes out.**Spoilers*** The scene where Del is horribly executed to death was just too sad to look at. This movie made me sympathize with criminals more than any other movie.The last half hour made me truly cry all the way through it. The film doesn't attempt to out do itself and just masters it all. The ending to the movie just continued to make me cry.John Coffey's death is perhaps, the saddest death I've ever seen in movie history. It was such a moving scene that truly made me think twice about life.***Spoilers ended*** 'The Green Mile' is a superbly acted, directed, written movie with fascinating characters and a moving story that is sure to make everyone cry and be totally glad that they saw this movie. I however, do not think I will ever sit through this 3 hour movie, as I cannot bear to be emotionally connected to these characters. Watching 'The Green Mile' again and again is not easy, but that's a good thing about the movie."

There is a clear sense here that all involved in the production knew that this was something special, and gave it their all. See this film if you truly enjoy actors giving everything to their craft. Watch for the countless subtleties of expression, and the great power that the cast creates with silence. This is evident in the opening sequence and remains throughout. Above all, Michael Duncan as John Coffey is exceptional. He brings gripping emotion to a unique, fascinating character.The Green Mile should bring you joy, laughter, and if you are like most in the theater this night, tears.BRAVO!"

My only complaint of The Green Mile is the length, I do think it is too long. However, The Green Mile is a film that is haunting, thought-provoking, moving and engrossing.The film is beautifully directed by Frank Darabont(director of the slightly superior The Shawshank Redemption), is beautifully shot with a foreboding setting and atmospheric cinematography and lighting and has an engrossing and haunting story that is well-paced too. Thomas Newman's score is positively hypnotic and very beautiful, with some great authentic song choices, my favourite being Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams(And Dream Your Troubles Away).The script is thoughtful too, and the movie also has a big emotional impact without feeling manipulative, I honestly couldn't help crying at the end of the movie. I have to say as well, the execution scenes were really quite harrowing. The performances are strong, Tom Hanks is excellent as the warden, as is Doug Hutchison who gives a credibility and complexity to a character that could have easily been clich\u00e9d and David Morse as Brutus. But Michael Clarke Duncan is the actor I want to give the real kudos to, he has a wonderful character and he absolutely nails it.Overall, a very, very good movie. Had it been shorter, it would have been perfect. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

            "Review": "An excellent prison epic which proves to be another splendid adaptation of a Stephen King novel \u2013 the bar has certainly been raised in the '90s for such adaptations after all the trash we got in the 1980s (MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE anybody? Thought not). THE GREEN MILE is a splendid exploration of man's psychology, interactions with other men, and attitudes towards life and death emphasised by the uncomfortable Death Row setting. The characters in this film are vividly portrayed by many accomplished actors and actresses and the film works best as a slow-burning character drama packed with incident and occasionally fireworks. Of course being a King story there is a supernatural aspect to the tale (a prisoner is able to perform miracles) but this does not detract from the realism that the film offers in its story.The narrative is excellent, the film a visual triumph, the special effects work limited and therefore effective. Tom Hanks is great as Paul Edgecomb, the sweaty guard who comes to believe that one of his captives is an angel sent from heaven, but best of all is big Michael Clarke Duncan in an emotional performance that will have any decent viewer reaching for the handkerchiefs during the course of the movie. Also welcome are excellent supporting turns from David Morse, Michael Jeter, and Barry Pepper as fellow prison guards, James Cromwell as the sympathetic Warden and Harry Dean Stanton being weird as always. But the characters who really stick in the mind are the villains: Sam Rockwell as the sleazy, psychopathic inmate who causes no end of grief, and particularly Doug Hutchison as perverted guard Percy. Hutchison, most familiar from his encore performance as mutant killer Tooms in two X-FILES performances back when the show was good, is fantastic in his part and really loathsome \u2013 evil, mean and treacherous, but also cowardly, childish and unthinking - a wondrous turn.The film runs the gamut of emotions from A to Z. Love, fear, wonder, anger, everything in the human condition is explored here at one point or another. There are also a number of shockingly violent moments more powerful than any horror film \u2013 this is truly a prison movie for modern times. The worst scene has a prisoner frying on the electric chair but not dying. Ten minutes later he finally dies having emptied the building. A truly gruesome and disturbing moment. THE GREEN MILE is suspenseful, exciting, moving, and often profound \u2013 not to mention tear-jerking at key points. Thus it gets two thumbs up from this viewer. Watch out for Mr Jingles, the cutest and cleverest mouse ever seen in a movie (forget MOUSE HUNT for sure)."

Hugely touching, emotive on every human level, a brilliant storyline, by all accounts a faithful screenplay and wonderfully cast. It's long, but the time flies.Hanks is superb here as is the inspired choice of Michael Clarke Duncan and in fact all of the cast. Even the mouse was brilliant!SPOILERS:It's the story of a simple man wrongly convicted of the worst type of crime. Set in a time where there is no real recourse to justice for such men and with a subplot that becomes the main focus of the film. Is John Coffey a gift from God and if so why are we allowing him to be legally murdered? That he ultimately doesn't mind, doesn't ease Paul's pain or the viewers pain at what we are watchingBoth Bitterbuck and Delacroix will make you question the death penaltyPercy's grossly offensive behaviour will make you question your humanity Paul Edgecomb will make you realise what a fantastically emotive actor Tom Hanks is and Duncan's John Coffey will make you weepHats off to you Mr Darabont once again and thank you for a truly beautiful film."

            "Review": "All the threads of Tolkien's magnum opus come together in the most elegant of fashions in the final part of Peter Jackson's adaptation. Humanity makes a last stand at Minas Tirith, the Hobbits travel through Mordor, our heroes try to by time for Frodo to complete his mission and the Evil Sauron gets tired of the whole game and lashes out with all his might and fury.\"Return of the King\" is 4 hours of payoff, a third act in a gigantic epic rather than a mere film of its own. As such it is intensely dramatic and dynamic and you can very much sense that though peter Jackson spared no effort on the previous episodes, this is clearly his favorite. the film floats by at a thunderous pace, taking us through unforgettable moments such as the battle of Minas Tirith itself, a marvel of seamless animation and epic film-making, it demands to be seen, as it has too many jaw-dropping moments to choose from. The quieter character moments keep gaining in potency and the full weight of the stakes and their heartbreaking consequences is never in doubt.The cast of these films have played their parts to perfection and again Jackson deserves overall credit for choosing actors that so perfectly match Tlolkien's creations: Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are their own usually excellent selves, and the hobbits remain endearing, but of all the uniformly great cast, the true standouts are Viggo Mortensen and David Wenham as the tragic Faramir, whose relationship with his brutish father is the most traumatic of the film. Jackson pushes them even further by having them sing at a few key moments (a practice employed to powerful effect by Tolkien in the books), a daring undertaking that works wonders. And though he may offer one ending too many, he does have the decency to show off each surviving character with the appropriate screen time and respect.Now that the trilogy is complete, it can be viewed as one big film, as it should be. After 8 years, Jackson has done the impossible: he has taken Tolkien's huge legend and made films that stand on their own and have revolutionized film-making, setting the new benchmark for cinematic epics. Changes have been made to Tolkien's source novels, but they make for better, more fluid films, more faithful in spirit to Tolkien's myth than anyone had the right to hope for.A masterpiece, whether as part of a bigger whole or on its own. Well deserving of all the high praise thrown at it, and then some..."

            "Review": "I admit it, I love all three Lord of the Rings films. People may say Return of the King is the best of the trilogy, some may say it is the worst. I personally think Two Towers is the best for its scope and better exploration of some of the characters, but while it is still great Return of the King is better than Fellowship of the Ring.My only slight disappointment is the ending, it does feel overlong and bloated for me, almost as if there was more than one ending filmed. That said, what does make the ending at least watchable for me is the way it is shot, the marvellous score and the performance of Gollum.Despite this minor discrepancy, Return of the King is extremely good and in my view one of the better Best Picture winners last decade. Peter Jackson's direction is very impressive here, and the scope is massive and just dazzling to watch. All three films of the trilogy are very well made, but Return of the King defines the term epic. The cinematography is mind-blowing, the scenery is superb, the costumes and make-up are well tailored, the effects are superb and don't distract too much and the lighting is authentic.The score is phenomenal. Fellowship of the Ring had some ethereal, rousing, haunting and charming themes, whereas Two Towers was somewhat darker and more complex. Return of the King merges these together and the result is a perfect mixture of charm, darkness, etherality and complexity. The story is compelling with themes of friendship, strength and loyalty, the screenplay is well-written and literate and while the film is very long the three hours or so fly by seamlessly. The characters are engaging, Aragorn is even more interesting here than he is in the previous films while Gollum continues to steal every scene he appears in.The acting is very good. Orlando Bloom(who I can find dashing yet uncharismatic and bland) and John Rhys-Davies are given less to do but do carry their parts very well, and Elijah Wood is likable enough. Sean Astin captures Sam perfectly and provides the heart of the picture, and Viggo Mortenssen is at his charismatic best here. Ian McKellen is perfectly cast, while the design of Gollum is still superb and Andy Serkis is equally phenomenal. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of any Sarauman, but I was more than I was satisfied with the final result.All in all, an outstanding entry to a great trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

            "Review": "Peter Jackson has done it.  He has created an all-encompassing epic saga of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books, and after coming away from the final chapter, how does this rate not only as a film on its own, but as a part of the whole?Perfect.I've never seen a series like this.  A trilogy of movies created with such love and care and utter perfection of craft that you can't help but walk away and wonder how did Peter Jackson make this possible?  I have always loved the original \"Star Wars\" and \"Indiana Jones\" series for their epic storytelling, and just for just fitting in as a great moment in cinema. This should be, will be, remembered with as much revered fondness for generations to come.  They do not make films like these anymore.As a stand alone film, it picks up immediately where \"Two Towers\" ends, so brush up before seeing it.  I've read the books, and the anticipation of seeing some of the more profound moments in this film made me kind of view it with a rushed sense of perspective.  I wanted to make sure everything in this film was done \"right\".  And when it happened, it was.  I will need to see this again to enjoy everything on a more casual level.The cast comes through once more.  The musical score retains its beauty, elegance and power.  The special effects, notably Gollum again, are nothing less than breathtaking, and simply move the story along.  The battles are monumentally huge and exciting.  There are some liberties taken with the story, especially during the end with the homecoming, and yet, everything that needed to be covered regarding the main characters was handled. After the greatest moment of the series resolves itself, the story provided a breather.  And gives a good-bye to friends seen on screen for the last three years.  It was truly a bittersweet feeling in realizing that there will be no \"Rings\" movie in 2004.  I will miss this talented group of actors.As with the first two, the film is very long, but goes by without you ever truly realizing it.  This film is so much more than a simple \"fantasy\" epic. It's a story about strength of character, friendship, loyalty and love. And while every member of the Fellowship has their part to play, I finally understood why some critics have said this series is a story about Sam. It's his unwavering resolve that led the quest to its victory.  Sean Astin is a true credit for adding the inspirational heart to this epic.  As as far as the ending goes, they ended it the way that it had to be ended. Jackson ended this film the way it should have been.I will miss looking forward to a new \"Rings\" movie, but these movies provide hope that high-quality films can still be made without special effects taking over a story, bathroom humor, or a \"Top 40\" soundtrack.  George Lucas could learn a lot from these films about how not to alienate the fanbase.Each film has earned a \"10\" from me for the last two years, which for me to give is a rarity.  This one, however, is as equally deserving as its two predecessors.  The Academy had better not look over this film for \"Best Picture\" of 2003.  To do so would be greatly disrespectful of the craft and care that anyone involved with these films put into them."

            "Review": "Obviously, I'm aware of the fact that the Lord of the Rings trilogy is actually one giant movie, but since it was released in parts, that's how I'm judging them. The Return Of The King is the final chapter, and since it is the climax and resolution of the epic journey, it has a little more intensity and urgency than the previous installments.At this point everyone has come to know and love all of the characters, and the stakes have become tremendously high. Kingdoms are at their knees, and the only two characters who can save the day are getting weaker and weaker. The tension was very high in this episode and I can honestly say that out of all 3 this was the only one that had me on the edge of my seat. There were many memorable scenes (one of my favourites including the part with the giant spider)that made this the classic that it is sure to stay for decades to come.This is the longest of the series, mostly because of the ending that seems to last a while. This was a good ending, and I can see why Frodo did what he did. He, and us the audience, have gone through an incredible ordeal and I think we needed that 20 minute linger. When the battle is over, and the celebrations have ended, there is a sad emptiness felt. The films spanned over 3 years, there have been the extended cuts of course, but after that, it's all over. Peter Jackson gave us an ending that was both appropriate and admirable.These were some amazing movies and this one in particular is the best, in my opinion. As whole, the Lord Of The Rings is a phenomenon. An absolute phenomenon. Much more than just movies. They have a universal appeal and have touched the hearts and imaginations of millions. I'm one of them.Sorry if I'm being all fanboyish and kissing this movie's ass, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favourites but generally this seems to be the movie event of the century. There will never be another Lord of the Rings film, and that's a bit depressing.My rating: 10/10"

            "Review": "I am in awe of the knowledge of some of the reviewers. I've been disappointed with virtually every film version of a beloved book that I have seen. I have not studied \"The Lord of the Rings\" though I have read the trilogy twice and parts several times. I know what a scholar Tolkien was and admire his work in linguistics as well as storytelling. The two entities do not need to cross over. If one really wanted to make the book you would have about two hours of poetry and a 56 hour movie. Movie-making is, unfortunately, forced to play by different rules. First of all, this film could not have been made until now. Imagine people dressed as trees. Remember those old Superman serials where whenever the Man of Steel flies, he becomes animated. Now that is genuinely bad. What Peter Jackson did here will be his legacy; had he died the day the film was complete, he would go down in film history. Everything is set up. The ring must be returned. Frodo is drunk with power and is latched on by the forces of evil. Those continuing the quest must face the ultimate and some do. Gollum is in the way, using his wiles to drive the ring back to him. The visual magnificence of Mount Doom and Mordor are unbelievable. One thing that is never mentioned is the incredible acting of most of the characters. Jackson may be a master of spectacle, but Frodo's character is a mass of impulses and expressions. He believes he is going to die and is afraid. Do you see a little bit of Christianity mixed in here? I'm not going down that road because, of course, the Bible is an epic too and has its own story. This is a movie about how friendship, loyalty, and sacrifice will out against evil. The evil is so remarkable and so oppressive.I can't begin to talk in the terms of other reviewers, but I do need to make sure that I weigh in on this film and the other two because this is a product of our society that we can all be proud of."

            "Review": "The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King is by far the most moving, inspirational and epic of the three parts in Peter Jackson's take on Tolkien's fantasy masterpiece. After proving that this trilogy can carry the weight of a truly enormous body of text with The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, Jackson has shown that nothing is impossible anymore when being brought to film, and that fantasy can be surreal, but grounded to reality.I saw this film at 8:00 PM, and missed school the following day -- exactly similar to The Two Towers when it was released. After seeing The Return of the King I was speechless. Never before had a film made such an impact on me as this conclusion did, and now with it completed, The Lord of the Rings is truly the best of the best.Jackson has treated this trilogy as one film, following to Tolkien's linear time-line, and not the way the books were written, which makes this a film that flows and never loses track of pacing. The dialogue is emotional, be it the speech between Gandalf and Pippin before the gates of Minas Tirith, or inspirational, such as the rousing deliveries by Theoden and Aragorn. The vast emotion makes this a film for the ages. Following our heroes adventure since film one, we have grown compassion for each and everyone of them. Sam's devotion to Frodo is something that can inspire, and the eu-catastrophe is fully used here once again, because just as it seems that all hope has been lost, it shines through the void and victory is achieved. If one were to fear that the ending would feel like there was no closure, then have none, because The Return of the King has a 20-minute denouement that goes as far as four-years into the future, and the ending on the shores of the Grey Havens brought me to tears.The special effects are nothing short of amazing. The blend of miniatures/bigatures and CGI is believable beyond comprehension, and the addition of New Zealand locales adds something beyond some peoples' wildest dreams. The level of detail on Minas Tirith is something no one has ever seen before, the massive armies sunder speakers as war erupts, and we see the Mumakil and the Fell Beasts in full fruition, as hinted in The Two Towers. What could've seem fatal, as cinematic history has shown before, is the introduction of Shelob the spider. The special effects team has created the most memorable spider in film history. She terrifies and drops jaws at the realism of such a beast.The tension for the siege on Minas Tirith is so highly anticipated, that the filmmakers have completely satisfied every expectation to how epic it could've been. The scope is just extraordinary. The battle of the Pelennor Fields is so huge in the book, yet it has been fully realized in Jackson's film. The final stand at the Black Gate is so emotional involving, it's hard to think that any action could top what was previously seen, but it is done so with vision beyond imagination.Howard Shore's music is also some of the most impressive and beautiful orchestration ever done for film. Besting its predecessors, The Return of the King's score is pure genius. From the new theme for Gondor, to the moving Into the West, Shore's composition sweeps and soars. Now that each of the three films' complete recordings have been released, I strongly urge a fan of the music to buy them, because they really are the best of the best.The acting even surpasses the first two, having the evolution of each character add to the dramatic effect, be it the loss of a life, or the triumph over evil. Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn is like a Godsend. Sean Astin steals nearly every scene he is in as Sam, making us hope he helps Frodo get rid of the Ring of Power. Once again, Andy Serkis provides a stirring and great performance as Smeagol/Gollum. The full weight of the Ring is realized in this film, and Elijah Wood makes us see his struggle like the Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers only hinted upon.Overall, The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King is remarkable. The battles are amazing, never making the film drag, and always heightening the tension. From the acting to the sound editing, this film delivers in what it promises, and that is the supreme motion picture of our lifetime, and many more years to come."

            "Review": "I am, I admit, an unlikely convert to the religion of Tolkienism. I  have never read the books, having, I thought, been put off them for  life by the sort of obsessive freaks who read them when I was at  school. (One classmate, then aged about sixteen, told me with great  pride that he had read the whole of 'The Lord of the Rings' at least  fifty times). I also have never been a great admirer of the 'sword and  sorcery' school of fantasy writing or film-making; indeed, some of this  genre (mostly those starring the current governor of California) struck  me as being among the worst films ever made.  I was, however, persuaded to see the first in the trilogy, 'The  Fellowship of the Ring', by its overwhelmingly positive reception from  the critics, and was quickly won over by the scope of Peter Jackson's  vision. I had been expecting some twee tale of elves, gnomes and  fairies; what I experienced was a genuine epic (in the true sense of  that overused word). Ever since December 2001, I have been waiting for  parts two and three of the trilogy to be released. Neither has  disappointed me.  The story of 'The Lord of the Rings' is too complex to be told in a  review such as this. Suffice it to say that it revolves around a magic  ring which will give its possessor immense power. The power-hungry Dark  Lord Sauron (a figure who is never actually seen on screen) desires to  obtain the ring in order to dominate Middle Earth. His enemies, led by  the wizard Gandalf, are seeking to destroy the ring, which can only be  used for evil purposes, not for good. At the beginning of the final  part of the trilogy, Sauron's forces are massing for an attack on the  kingdom of Gondor.  The film relates the story of the conflict which follows, and this  leads to some of the most spectacular battle sequences I have seen,  even more impressive than those in 'The Two Towers'. Inevitably, the  film makes much use of computer-generated effects, but unlike many  films dominated by special effects, plot and character are not  neglected. The acting is uniformly good, and in some cases outstanding.  Special mentions must also go to the camera-work, which made the best  possible use of the magnificent New Zealand scenery, and to Howard  Shore's memorable musical score.  So, looking forward to the Oscar ceremony, I have no doubt that this  should be the best film and that Peter Jackson, who has amply fulfilled  the promise shown in the excellent 'Heavenly Creatures', should be best  director. Best Actor? I would find it difficult to decide between the  competing claims of Sir Ian McKellen, who brings wisdom, kindliness and  the required touch of steel to his portrait of Gandalf, and of Elijah  Wood, who plays the brave and resourceful hobbit Frodo to whom falls  the dangerous task of ensuring the ring's destruction. Best Supporting  Actor? My own nomination would be for Sean Astin, as Frodo's loyal  companion Sam, but several others might have claims, notably Viggo  Mortensen or Bernard Hill.  Is this the best movie ever made, as some of its admirers have claimed?  Possibly not- that is, after all, a very large claim to make. I have no  doubt, however, that the trilogy as a whole is the first great  cinematic masterpiece of the twenty-first century. It has certainly  inspired me to start reading Tolkien's original novels. 10/10."

            "Review": "Frodo and Sam continue their desperate journey to destroy the ring, Gollum has his eyes very much on the prize, knowing they cannot possibly get past Sauron's army, Aragorn creates a diversion.Surely this is a contender for the greatest film of all time, I can think of nothing negative to say, it's everything you want in a movie and more. Action packed, intriguing, funny and several scenes that will pull a few years from your eyes.The greatest battle scenes of all time, they are as relentless as they are breathtaking, if you like action, this is the film for you.There isn't a single lull, at no point does it ever dip, it doesn't matter which character the focus is on, it captivates, that opening sequence with Gollum was off the scale, as was the final, epic battle.I will only watch the extended version, as I find Christopher Lee's absence in the theatrical cut unforgivable, I know it's about four hours long, but that doesn't matter, you lose all sense of time in the wonder and brilliance.McKellen, Mortensen, Wood, everyone associated, incredible.This film truly is one of the best ever made.10/10."

            "Review": "Finally, the last movie in the series. Finally, Peter Jackson makes his intentions clear. Now we realise that the first two movies in this series were just the build up to this epic of a film. A masterful masterpiece, a flawless work of cinema whose only fault is that it seems too short. I don't have much to say about this; I don't want to spoil anything. But this is the big one. It completely blows the other two great movies out of the water. Suddenly, everything is more adult, more dramatic, and ten times the emotion. You could call it an emotional roller-coaster ride; certainly Jackson touches the nerves and heart-strings on more than one occasion.The centrepiece of the film is the battle for Minas Tirith, a huge war scene which features amazing special effects unlike anything ever seen before. An army of 300,000 riders on the heroes who defend their city with courage and spirit. Dragons fly down from the sky, huge boulders are tossed back and forth, and an army of trolls and oliphants are sent in to obliterate the heroes. Everything is dark and gruesome; Jackson reveals his origins by including many graphic and gruesome deaths which somehow make the 12A certificate a bit of a joke. Men are decapitated, crushed, impaled, and burnt. Heads fly over city walls and the viewer just sits and gapes at the magnificence of it all.The casting is excellent. Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen come into their own. Billy Boyd is given serious stuff to deal with now, not just comic relief: his singing over the death of the soldiers is extremely moving and a stand against all generals who sit back and send their men to certain death. Miranda Otto comes into her own. The new character of Denethor is great, just as in the book. Legolas and Gimli are still there, although on the sidelines as always. But the real emotion comes from Elijah Wood and Sean Astin: this pair are brilliant, and their final journey to Mount Doom will bring tears to anybody's eyes through the heartache involved. Gollum is a force to be reckoned with this time and cannot be forgotten.After the slow build-up of the initial hour, things explode in cinematic heaven. The battles are amazing, topped by the arrival of the ghost army, sheer brilliance. Shelob is a wonderful special effect and extremely frightening. There is so much to love and thankfully the powerhouse ending doesn't disappoint. The only problem with this film is that it properly ends about 30 minutes before the credits, and Jackson fills the final 30 minutes with endless mawkish sentimentality which becomes truly sickening. Sadly, it doesn't spoil what's come before; I just tune out at this part."

            "Review": "Just as Peter Jackson felt that LOTR had to be made as one large, three-part, cinematic piece, I decided to write my IMDb review of all three movies as a single, multi-part essay. Click on my screen-name and hit \"Chronological\" to view my reviews of the Fellowship and Two Towers. I make no guarantees about the quality and consistence of my review, but I do guarantee that these three films offer very high and very consistent quality from beginning to end. The acting, cinematography, art, and direction simply can not be beat.Which of the three movies is my favorite varies with my mood \u0096 and the same holds true for Tolkien's books. When I am immersed in the story, ROTK is my favorite. When I simply want to have fun with the whole experience, I love Fellowship. And when I want something intense, evocative and thoughtful, I go for the Two Towers.Frodo, Sam and Golem are on their way to Mount Doom and their bodies, nerves, and relationships have borne the greatest burden on middle earth. The rest of the fellowship is rallying to the defense of Minas Tirith, and preparing for even more deadly battles to come.The heroism and romance are incredibly moving - when was the last time you saw an entire audience leaving a theater after a fantasy movie rubbing their eyes? The sets are breathtaking - even moreso than in the previous two films.The casting and acting are superb.The film delivers at every level and is the jewel in the trilogy's well-earned crown.Return of the King offers a resolution of all of the major story arcs in LOTR. As with the classic Tolkien trilogy, however, you may be able to predict some of what will occur, but never all of it and you'll never guess how you will get there. The same fatalistic and paradoxically unpredictable feeling of Tolkien's grand plots is present throughout ROTK especially. The major theme in ROTK, however, is the varied ways and means of heroism \u0096 both intentional and unintended, and Tolkien's examination of sacrifice and heroism is as inspiring as it is subtle. Amazingly, it all comes through in the films.Even more than the previous two films, Jackson and his writers took liberties with the story-line. Like the others, however, this serves the film better than simple adaptation from one medium to another. By reordering some of the chronology and adding scenes and plot devices which are consistent with Tolkien's world and characterizations, the film-makers actually do a better job of preserving the concepts and themes of the story than they could have with a pure adaptation. The lengthy epilogue in Tolkien's book is greatly reduced, reordered, and somewhat changed in order to work in the film. Some parts actually appear very early in ROTK. And some aspects of Tolkien's epilogue are disclosed in the Two Towers, though not directly depicted. But all of the really important components of the epilogue are, at least strongly implied if not well illustrated in ROTK."

            "Review": "Feeling weary and battle-worn, I have just staggered out of the cinema after three and a half hours of special effects creatures fighting other special effects creatures. I had taken refreshments but barely touched them - probably because the film I had watched is one of the most mesmerising, evocative, inspiring, and awesome I have witnessed of any big adventure epic. Not to mention superb ensemble acting, moods that shift effortlessly between mediaeval battles of colossal proportions and convincing bloodshed, beauty and wonderment, fantastic natural and artificial landscapes and cityscapes, touches of humour, well-paced dramatic tension, and human bonding that is moving enough to just let you dry your eyes as the unassuming credits flash by.Return of the King is the greatest of the Tolkien trilogy by New Zealand director Peter Jackson. Although I've seen the other two and read the book, I felt it would also stand alone well enough for people who hadn't done either.The storytelling is much more professional that the first one - which maybe laboured to introduce so much information - or the second one - which has little let up from the tension of long battle scenes. In Return of the King, there is an emotional sting at the start, as we watch the transformation of Gollum from warm, fun-loving guy to murderous, mutated wretch. The movie then moves deftly between different segments of the story - the sadness of the lovely soft-focus Liv Tyler as fated Arwen whose travails and woman's love succeeds in having the Sword that was Broken mended, the comradeship of Sam and Frodo (Sean Astin & Elijah Wood) that is tested to the limits, the strong commanding presence of Gandalf (Ian McKellen) who keeps an eye on things whilst turning in an Oscar-worthy performance, the ingenious and very varied battle scenes, and the mythical cities of that rise out of the screen and provide key plot elements.This is a fairy story of human endeavour, the defeating of power cliques and the triumph of the human spirit that could almost be compared to Wagner's Gotterdammerung. It is a fairy story without any sugary sweetness, a fairy story the likes of which hasn't been told so well before, and is even unlikely to be done so well in the future. The haunting scream of the Nasgul stays with you, the physical attractions are not airbrushed, and the battles are about as far from pantomime characters waving wooden swords as you can get. The ingenious monsters keep you on the edge of your seat. The whole narrative maintains the spirit (if not archival, detailed accuracy) of the original and makes you want to read the book (or read the book again!)The worst I can say about it is that it is maybe a tad long - but not that you'd notice . . ."

            "Review": "Where to start with this masterpiece? Quite simply one of the greatest movies ever made. A fitting end to a stunning trilogy. The acting as it has been is brilliant again. Special mention must go to Sean Austin, for his performance as Sam. In this one he gets his big moment in the trilogy, and he nails it perfectly. His scenes with Elijah Wood (Frodo) on Mount Doom, as Frodo weakens are full of emotion and very powerful. As for the rest of the movie? It has one of the greatest scenes EVER in a movie : the riders of Rohan charging into battle outside Minas Tirith. You simply cannot tell where the real riders end, and the CGI begins. The battles again are well done, and not simply a repeat of the siege at Helms Deep in The Two Towers.As I said, the acting is again first rate from the entire cast. And it was nice to see Andy Serkis getting his face on screen as Smeagol, before his transformation into Gollum.By the end of the movie, there were more than a few tears as the boat left the Grey Havens, as the movie ended on a quiet emotional note, after the epic battles before.I could happily have sat through this again and again. Well done to everyone, both in front and behind the cameras for such a brilliant work, but of course special mention has to go to Peter Jackson. He deserves every award he's received for this.One last point. If you only seen the theatrical release, then go get the extended version of this film. It's even better!!"

            "Review": "After a brief prologue showing us how Sm\u00e9agol came to get the ring and how he came to be the pitiful creature we know the film proper starts where The Two Towers left off; Sm\u00e9agol is continuing with his plan to lure Frodo and Sam to their doom in Shelob's lair and Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are reunited with Merry and Pippin at Isengard.When Pippin looks into the palant\u00edr, a sort of dark crystal ball, he sees the city of Minas Tirith under attack, unfortunately he himself is seen by Sauron. Galdalf takes him to Minas Tirith when he rides there to warn of the impending attack while the others remain behind to raise an army large enough to assist in that coming battle.I thought that the battle of Helm's Deep was impressive but it seems a mere skirmish compared to the battle of Minas Tirith, here there are thousands of Orcs supported by mercenaries mounted on gigantic elephant like creatures that are large enough to crush a man and his horse under their giant feet. All the time this battle rages Frodo and Sam are journeying deeper and deeper into the land of Mordor to Mount Doom in order to end Sauron's reign once and for all.This is probably the best film of the trilogy, I can see why it raked in the awards, the only weakness was the epilogue once the quest was completed the film could have ended at the crowning of the king rather than going on to their return to the Shire... even though I'm aware that this was in the book. Peter Jackson did a fantastic job bringing such an epic story to the screen, he was of course assisted by a fantastic cast who really brought the characters to life."

            "Review": "Weary beyond words, Hobbit companions Frodo and Sam continue their journey to destroy the One Ring, with the sinister Gollum still their guide. The film opens interestingly with Gollum's origin story, capturing his descent into depravity and madness, finding the ring in much the same manner in which he lost it. The ring has the power to affect it's bearer, and not for good.With the battle of Helm's Deep over and Saruman's power gone, the attention focuses on the capital of Gondor, Minas Tirith. There the race of men must make a last stand before the growing might of an unseen enemy, while those visible are more of a threat than ever. \"The Return of the King\" in it's way is as much Aragorn's story as it is Frodo's; a reluctant noble struggling to find his destiny who comes to accept and eventually embrace it under the tutelage of the White Wizard Gandalf. The subtle subtext of Aragorn's relationship with Lady Arwen of the Elven realm leads to his triumph with no illusions for Eowyn, establishing a noble grace and dignity for the new King.Upon my second viewing of the entire trilogy, I was surprised at how my attention was continually drawn to the character of Samwise Gamgee, Frodo's faithful companion. This in large part to the excellent portrayal by Sean Astin, showing a range of emotions throughout the film that proffered him as the most well developed character of the story. He's a loyal friend through thick and thin, understanding clearly that by the journey's near end, Frodo's mind may no longer be his own.Gimli is another character to keep a close eye on for the understated humor John Rhys-Davies brings to the story. The personal competition he began with Legolas (Orlando Bloom) in \"The Two Towers\" finds comic resonance here; as Legolas brings down a rampaging olyphant on the Pelennor Fields, Gimli tempers his congratulations with \"That still only counts as one\" - marvelous! With the One Ring destroyed, so is Sauron's awesome power, and a quest resolved for the fortunes of mankind. The film's multiple endings encapsulate just as many feelings in the viewer, those of loyalty, honor, love, sacrifice and friendship. As a unit, the Lord of the Rings Trilogy stand as probably the ultimate in cinematic adventure to this point in time. Truly, I can only make one suggestion to make the series even more poignant, that for a film that reveals the discovery of the One Ring by Bilbo Baggins, the basis for the adventure that begins in \"The Hobbit\"."

            "Review": "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is, hands down, among the most spectacular and magnificent films of all time.A short run-down of the plot: After the battle of Helm's Deep and Saruman's imprisonment in his tower Orthanc, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Gandalf re-group with Merry and Pippin in Isengard. There they learn that the army of Sauron is planning a full-scale attack on the largest city of men - Minas Tirith in Gondor. Gandalf and Pippin ride to Minas Tirith to warn Denethor, the steward of Gondor, of the threat from Mordor. Defenses are built up as the army of Sauron marches across the Pelennor Fields towards Minas Tirith. A distress call is sent to Rohan, still recovering from Helm's Deep. Rohan manage to muster a large army, and set out for Minas Tirith, but the battle has already begun. In the meantime, we continue with Sam and Frodo on their quest to destroy the One Ring.A major achievement of this epic film is the character development. Gollum becomes more cunning and sneaky than ever, and manages to turn Frodo against Sam, who is desperately trying his best to get his old Frodo back. Merry and Pippin are no longer just a source of comic relief, both of them prove themselves worthy as they are split up for the final battle. We learn about the true bravery and potential of hobbits as Merry helps cut down the Witch King. Eowyn also proves herself in the film, as she defies her uncle and sets out to Pelennor fields with the other Rohirrim, and eventually destroys the Witch King, and makes a very feminist remark while doing so. We learn to loathe Denethor because of his hatred of his last remaining son, Faramir, who really hasn't done anything wrong. The peak of our hatred for Denethor is reached in the scene where he tells Faramir that he would have preferred it if he had died instead of Boromir, his brother. And then, right after that, Denethor sends Faramir into certain suicide, and Faramir immediately accepts the mission he is appointed to, in a final attempt to please his father. And of course, Aragorn learns to accept his fate as the true king of men.In fact, the character development is so powerful that we actually participate in the character's feelings. We FEEL Frodo's exhaustion and agony as he literally drags himself across Mordor. We feel Sam's pain as Frodo is turned against him. And, just briefly, we participate in Gollum's triumph as he finally gets the One Ring. We are actually happy for Gollum and just for a brief moment, Frodo becomes the bad guy as he tries to take the ring back. All in all, Return of the King contains the most moving, emotional and touching scenes in the entire trilogy, and some of the best acting, especially from Sean Astin (Sam), Elijah Wood (Frodo), Ian McKellen (Gandalf), John Noble (Denethor, he is very successful in adding depth to his character), Miranda Otto (Eowyn), and of course, Andy Serkis (Smeagol, and top-notch at it, just like in The Two Towers).The battle of Pelennor fields may be THE most spectacular and epic sequence in film history. Unlike Helm's Deep, Pelennor Fields shows the true cleverness of Sauron's army. Orcs are not the only participants; trolls are heavily used in the battle, as warriors and as beasts of burden. The nazgul are very significant in the battle, and while the Witch King didn't actually lead the battle as he did in the book, the nine ringwraiths and their fell beasts still play a key part and do lots of damage in the battle. We see just how powerful the nazgul really are. And of course, the men from the south and their massive oliphaunts play a significant part. While in Helm's Deep we felt triumphant, in Pelennor fields we only feel the triumph briefly, as the Rohirrim make their charge into the horde of orcs and trolls. The triumph in Pelennor Fields almost immediately dissolves, as the Rohirrim are trampled down by the oliphaunts. The battle is won, but we're not happy, we're grieved for all the destruction, all the losses. It's a totally different feeling than Helm's Deep, and makes this battle all the more superior.Return of the King features the most magnificent visuals in the entire trilogy. Whether they are of Minas Tirith, Pelennor Fields and Osgiliath, Mordor and the slopes of Mt. Doom or the climb to Shelob's cave near Minas Morgul, Peter Jackson really shows us the true impact of these landscapes and images.Many people may complain about the changes in the movie, especially the significant cut of Saruman from the end, but you must realize that if they would have featured the whole part with Saruman the movie would have continued another hour and a half. Don't fret; Peter Jackson said the scenes will all appear in the extended version of the film. The ending is long enough as it is, and the film continues at least another half an hour after the Ring is no more. The hobbits return to the shire, and Sam marries Rosie. Aragorn meets his fate and is crowned king, and is finally reunited with Arwen. And of course, one of the most moving scenes in the movie, in which Frodo gets on the last ship to the Undying lands with Bilbo, Gandalf, and the last of the elves (Galadriel and Elrond to name a few), and must part with his three hobbit friends for good.All in all, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is one the most fine-tuned, cinematically perfect films ever made, it's absolutely flawless in every aspect. The Lord of the Rings trilogy as a whole is a spectacular achievement in film making history, and all three movies are together, without a doubt, the greatest epic ever made."

And I watched more than a thousand movies. I watched so many directors from so many countries. My cinema taste changed too much since my first watch of this movie. But this movie is still the best for me, not even a single movie reached to it's level. This is why I think the movie is the best movie of the future also. I don't think my thoughts will ever change.This movie is not about the war of men and orcs or any other peoples. This movie about the insignificant people versus the worlds biggest thread ever. That thread is actually unbeatable.\"You did not seriously think that a hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron? There are none who can. Against the power of Mordor there can be no victory.\"\nSaruman\"Hobbits really are amazing creatures. You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month, and yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you at a pinch.\"\nGandalfBoth dialogues from the first movie.

The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture, the only time in history a fantasy film has done so.The Return Of The King is the longest of the three films, which suffers from having to cut between disparate story strands, and - in its final half-hour - stacks up endings one after the other, like jet planes waiting to land, the director visibly reluctant to let these characters go. Most audiences will forgive Peter Jackson for that, for this is a fitting conclusion to a series of films made with tremendous artistry and affection for their subject; thrilling spectacle is underscored with palpable human drama, and it finally becomes clear why J.R.R. Tolkien's books continue to ring such bells so loudly in the lives of so many."

            "Review": "I have an interesting history and relationship with this film. Never before has a film made me question the nature of reality before. At first glance, The Matrix at the surface might have looked like a really good action movie with some cutting edge special effects with a kinetic and engaging story, and it definitely has that, but on my first viewing of this movie back in 2006 when I was 9 years old and slid this DVD into my small box TV at the end of my bed. I had absolutely no idea what I was in for and what I was about to experience.This movie is actually more disturbing and honestly terrifying than many would let on, especially to a young child when this movie drops some major psychological and philosophical themes in it's first act. The first 40 minutes of The Matrix is frankly terrifying and suspenseful in all the best and right ways.The surreal bugging scene with that crazy bug with the long tendrils swirling around in what looks like a higher frame rate than the rest of the shot around it, followed by the mirror scream and the metallic drowning scream followed by the waking up in the pod of human entrails scene, followed by the highly messed up \"How do you define 'real'\" Where the concept of reality literally goes up in quotation marks and flies away, where the movie sets the tone that 'reality is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain' is the most we humans can make of our surroundings - almost makes the concept of The Matrix scarily plausible - and also in a way kind of timely of how the Internet has evolved leaps and bounds since 1999 and the plausibility of VR at the moment (I mean have you seen Half-Life Alyx)And of course you have the explanation of the matrix that follows. Truly one of the heaviest exposition scenes in cinema history.And that's about as far as I survived my first viewing of this movie all those years ago. As a kid's first viewing, this movie successfully found it's way inside my head and left my mind shattered literally unable to watch any more. You would think that would be a terrible thing to say about a movie, but not here. The Matrix is an unparalleled and unprecedented movie experience as humanity is at the core of this movie.The first act plays as a setup for such a hopeless notion as the nature of the matrix is revealed, only to have this notion flipped on it's head when the matrix itself starts being a fun place to be in the eyes of Neo and the evolution of his character aswell as the rebels that he meets that teach him of the humanity that underlies every person trapped inside it under the oppression of the inhuman controllers.Once the true nature of the matrix is revealed. You can bend it to your will and then you can do whatever you want. The Matrix is the ultimate story and parable of humanity overcoming and opressive and dystopian scenario, being controlled by machines, and is masterful in it's writing and direction. The casting was very well thought out with Keanu Reeves killing it as Neo, aswell as Laurence Fishburne and Carrie Anne-Moss as great supporting roles, with Hugo Weaving as an extremley strong Sci-Fi villan as the cold, sociopathic AI Villan Agent Smith.With Neo as the embodiment of humanity against Smith which is devoid of such, follows an unforgettable experience of human over machine. A classic and terrifyingly brilliant film which may cause you to have an internal existential crisis, but that's just the power of this film."

Iconic scenes are still having benchmarks setting up.If we say it sci-fi at its best, it won't be wrong. The hype was real, it is still not easy to match the level of Matrix where we experience the connection of humans and science, that too with amazing action fight and chase scenes, not just normal scenes they were, multiple exposures, slow motion 3D moves, Oh My God, and it's understandable as well like what are the characters up to and what storyline they are entering into. The script was very well written and executed otherwise it could have been a mess. A special appreciation in managing the theme with those black color costumes and a scientific zone with unimaginable equipment and props doing unbelievable things in the two worlds created. No spoilers, but the action scenes in the climax where the protagonist goes to save someone from agents are really breathtaking. The technology used at its best.A salute to Wachowski Brothers and the team for creating this masterpiece. It will be a great competition and motivation as well for many films coming in the future."

Deserving of its praise, though not perfect.The concept and the villains are what I love most about it. Everything about the agents excellent, Hugo Weaving gives his best performance. Cypher who's Judas, the true villain of the film, the most sensible. The character development and the choice of casting in regards to Trinity, the only real weakness of the film. I feel like we could of got to know the Neo character some before this, we have no idea what he's thinking at any point, all we know is that he was the greatest hacker and that's because he's the one. The trinity character's too butch, the other female crew member in a lesser role too, what's with this? Like Cypher, I would rather just go back into the Matrix. I get that you become hardened in a certain environment, but I don't see that as the case here. So Trinity loves Neo and he has to love her back, okay. Laurence Fishburne's terrific as Morpheus."

            "Review": "** May contain spoilers **There aren't many movies I watched in the theatre twice \u0096 let alone on the same day - but immediately after the credits had rolled (and still pumped up by 'Rage against the Machine'), I queued up for the next screening of 'The Matrix'. I was so blown away by that film, I feared - and probably rightly so - that I hadn't caught every detail of what I'd just seen. I later found out that many of my friends had had a similar reaction to the film, and I know virtually no one who liked the film and didn't watch it at least twice. It's simply one of those rare films that are so rich you just have to watch them several times.In structure, style and concept, 'The Matrix' was ground-breaking; it marked the first time the visual style of Manga comic books and Anime such as 'Akira' or 'Ghost in the Shell' had been successfully translated to a live-action film. Apart from 'Blade Runner', which has a totally different mood and pace (but is also a masterpiece and visionary film-making), there simply hadn't been anything even remotely like it. The jaw-dropping action sequences have such a raw, gripping energy they feel like an adrenalin overdose, but unlike most action films, they never overshadow the story; on the contrary - they enhance it and make complete sense within that universe.As for the story itself, I think this is one of the most original, fascinating Sci-Fi tales you'll likely ever see on screen. Clearly inspired by Japanese Anime and Manga yet also by authors like Isaac Asimov or Philip K. Dick, the story about humanity's war against its own creation, machines of an artificial intelligence that have evolved to the point where they have become the dominant 'species' and vastly superior to their creators, could take place in the same world as 'Blade Runner' or 'The Terminator' - albeit several hundred years later. But there is also a mythical, even religious undercurrent to the story; the themes of a prophecy, a \"liberator\" or even a \"messiah\" make 'The Matrix' transcend the Science-Fiction genre and become even more unique.'The Matrix' was a watershed moment in filmmaking \u0096 in every respect \u0096 and even though two inferior sequels have left a bit of a stain on the film, they can't distract from what an uncompromising and hugely influential masterpiece this is. Sci-Fi movies that were released after 'The Matrix' have tried very hard to achieve a similar look and tone, but the original still owns them all. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"

            "Review": "Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn't until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won't say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.Acting wise the film works excellently. I won't say that there aren't any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don't wan't to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.The reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn't see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) but also hidden in his other name, Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name, Anderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning \"man\" and combine this with the second part of his last name \"son\" and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination \"son of man\" which was a title Jesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man calls him (and I quote): \"You're my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ.\" It doesn't get any more obvious than that. Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard's essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.To all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can only give one advice: Free your mind and watch the film again. You won't regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either The Matrix (obviously I don't expect people to agree but if they do thats great) or The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and people who like philosophy.10/10 - on my top 3 of best films."

            "Review": "My review of the best epic Science Fiction Action film, The Matrix (1999) starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Joe Pantoliano, Marcus Chong and Gloria Foster.This was be the first movie I went to see in the movie theater with my mom when I was 15.years old, when I read in the magazines about The Matrix I was blown away and I wanted to see it right away. The Matrix is the best action sci-fi films that Keanu Reeves made in the 90's. It is one of my personal favorite movies. The Matrix is a (1999) American science fiction action film written and directed by The Wachowskis, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano. It depicts a dystopia future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called \"the Matrix\", created by sentient machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Computer programmer \"Neo\" learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, which involves other people who have been freed from the \"dream world\".Written and directed by the Wachowski brothers, this classic sci-fi action film stars Keanu Reeves as a lowly computer programmer who discovers his entire existence, and that of all mankind, is nothing but a simulation in a computer. The reality within a reality is a concept that's done before... but never like this - The Matrix requires absolute attention from his audience, least you'll be completely lost in a few minutes. With the help of supporting cast members Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne-Moss, Reeves discovers that inside this simulation environment known as The Matrix, he can control, bend, and manipulate space-time... resulting in some of the most incredibly iconic images to ever grace the silver screen. The slow-motion \"bullet-time\" effects as they're known today were groundbreaking and revolutionary when we first saw them 12 years ago. Although Reeves is notorious for his inability to really convey much emotional range, his character here lends itself well to him as an actor. This is a movie that makes you think, makes you gasp, and makes totally forget where the 136-minutes went after finishing it. It's no wonder this film spawned two very successful sequels, and dozens of copy-cats. The Matrix, \"Visually revolutionary, and mind-blowing.\" Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix. He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. He also played the roles in Underrated Daredevil (2003)and Bad Boys I & II. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor.

Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.The film also won 4 Academy Awards including for best visual effects. \n10/10 for one of the best epic American science fiction action film's in the history movies like this and Aliens (1986) don't exist anymore. It is one of my personal favorite movies, it is the movie I saw with my mom in the movie theater it is memories on my mom who is no longer with us anymore and I miss he."

            "Review": "'The Matrix' may not be one of the very greatest examples of its genre (like '2001', 'Metropolis', 'Blade Runner', 'Back to the Future', 'Star Wars Original Trilogy', 'Alien' and 'Aliens'), but that it is revolutionary in how its visuals and use of sound broke boundaries like had never been done before cannot be denied.It is not a film to be seen if people want character depth or relationship depth, with the forced and underdeveloped love subplot between Neo and Trinity being 'The Matrix's' sole weak spot. This ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.Particularly striking about 'The Matrix' is its production values. Simply put, the film looks amazing in its audacious production design, dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist, super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. So much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.Use of sound was also striking, and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. Andy and Larry Wachowski direct adeptly, while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes, mysticism, philosophy and even Lewis Carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.Action is superbly shot and edited, and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy, Kung Fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds, this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.Keanu Reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler, certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. Carrie Anne Moss is strong. Even better are an imposingly charismatic Laurence Fishburne (also in one of his best roles), an amusing Joe Pantoliano and a deliciously wicked Hugo Weaving.Summing up, not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one. Followed by two sequels, both nowhere near in the same ball-park. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

            "Review": "At first, I wasn't interested in seeing the Matrix. But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.I really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.The plot is one of the best movie plots I've seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away."

It's not just about the war between AI and humanity. It's more about questioning the reality.And years later the idea is never gets old. This is the movie that you should respect if someone says \"I think this is the greatest movie of all time.\" because it has somethings unique, not special it's just unique.It's beyond all the Science-Fiction movies. Normally Sci-Fi movies mades you think \"Can this subject of the movie be real someday?\" and actually only some of them made you think that way. This one mades you think \"I can't deny, this could be our reality. We can never be sure.\"Besides making one of the greatest Fictional Universes, this movie also achieves so much more.And not only that, this movie is also achieves something great in Action. It has the most iconic action scenes. Action director is so great. Revolutionary VFX and SFX, amazing Set Decoration and more."

            "Review": "20 years after its release, and several years since I last saw it, some reflections on the experience of rewatching The Matrix. In no particular order ...1) It still look great. I mean, this is one amazing, stylish looking phone. Very little about the look of the film has dated - the mobile phones, obviously, Neo's computer, and very briefly a couple of visual effects creak. But otherwise, this looks as amazing at it did on release. It's sumptuous.2) I think I was one of the many who misjudged Keanu Reeves all those yeas ago. I made easy jokes about his vacant stare and apparent intelligent. From this vantage point we can see he's been in a good number of successful, intelligent films. It's also become clear that within the industry he as a reputation as decent, hardworking man who is a pleasure to work with.3) It's apparent again how literate and cine-literate the film is. I knew this 20 years ago, but since then I've seen a lot more films and read a lot more books, and this time around I especially loved the way the film nods its head to other film genres and influences. I noticed a lot of Peckinpah, and did I see a nod to Kurosawa there too? And I was reminded that for an English Literature graduate like me, this is a goldmine of quotes, allusions and references.4) Seen 20 years on, its influence on cinema since is clear. There's a lot we could talk about here, but I was especially struck by how indebted a director like Christopher Nolan is (keeper of the flame of intelligent blockbusters), especially with Inception.5) I'd forgotten that the narrative ostensibly maintains uncertainty about Neo's identity until just before the end. I'm not sure this really works - anyone who's read many books or ever done an anagram will not find that the most suspenseful part of the narrative.6) Despite a run time of 2 and a quarter hours, it never flags and attention never wonders. The film fizzes with kinetic energy and the time flies by. It's a lean film, without a wasted moment.7) The film is, of course, packed with religious allusions. When I wrote a chapter on this for my BA Theology dissertation, I said I thought the film was neo-Bhuddist (forgive the pun, please), and I stand by that on rewatching. Of course, there's lots of allusions to Christian and other theology, and The Matrix spawned some really bad reading of film by Christians which has never really stopped. When will some Christians learn to read a film/book etc with integrity and understanding of what the film is trying to do? It's a spiritually confused mish-mash of a film - but still a gloriously entertaining one.8) All these years later, it turns out The Matrix was somewhat prophetic about the role technology would play in our lives. Humans permanently plugged in to networks? Different layers of reality that are somehow more real than what we think of as real? The Wachowskis saw all that and more coming 20 years ago. Artists are the weather vane of society; we really should learn to pay attention to them.9) Bottom line. I still bloody love this film. I'm trying to work out if I have the requisite strength to revisit the sequels...."

            "Review": "You name it. Technology, CGI, flow of the story, the concept, action, romance, style, music,... everything you want is realized in this movie to the level of perfection. The scene where Neo and Trinity go to the virtual reality to save Morpheus is so fashionable that I screamed. The camera angle, costume, music, and the gunfights.. all these qualities shine the heroes. The entertainment value of this movie should not be overlooked because of its high quality and philosophy.I can see how much research Wachowski sisters put in to make their imaginations and concepts realized in the two-hour movie in plausible ways. How is dystopian future and present is connected? How does dream within a dream work? All the questions about their imaginary world is answered because they pay attention to details and they explain every existence and terms with logic one step at a time. There is no leap of logic, very tightly well-woven script.Their concept is not just future or imaginary anymore. In 2020, we see AI taking over many of works and jobs that humans used to do and invading privacy. Virtual reality games gain popularity over time, and you see Neo everywhere who adapts quickly in the Internet world and learn the combat game so fast and naturally.The impact of 'The Matrix' in the movie industry is more than imaginable. Of course, revolutionary visual effects with elaborated CGI techniques created iconic bullet-dodging scene of Neo. Because the Matrix system in the movie is kindly well-explained, it widens a scale of sci-fi genre. Hunger Games, Inception, Eagle Eye, Wall-E, and so many other movies that followed benefited from this epic work."

I like the idea of combining movies and theory.I am now studying metaphysics, and any study of reality begins with Ren\u00e9 Descartes, the father of modern philosophy. Descartes began his intellectual odyssey with this question: How do we know that there is a reality outside our own minds? We each know that we have experiences, and we can be sure of these experiences; therefore, each of us can be sure that we exist. But how do we know that the internal experiences we have corresponds to objects outside our minds?This is the whole theme of The Matrix. Watching this film is like studying metaphysics."

            "Review": "Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.The direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.The cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow-motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.In conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories waiting for interpretation. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made."

            "Review": "The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.Hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre.  There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.)  There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects.  With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync.  Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition.  Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes.  The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky.  The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of.  The photography was breathtaking.  (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.)  And the acting?  Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did.  But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting.  As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked!  Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne.  His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation.  My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE.  What is the Matrix, you ask?  Something that's closer to reality than you think.Either that or it's my personal choice for best film of all-time."

            "Review": "This is one of those movies that \"everyone\" has seen, except me. I tried to watch it with some friends about fifteen years ago, but they had two kids under five years old and I was only able to ingest it in five minute increments. So a friend lent me the video and I finally got a chance to see it. It's a pretty remarkable film. The premise of an alternative reality works here where it often fails. Keanu Reeves is a sort of messiah, not by his own choosing originally. He has been attacked and abused by men in sunglasses whom, we find out later, are a part of a representation of Artificial Intelligence. The side Neo ends up on are the original humans whose ranks have been nearly driven to extinction. Laurence Fishburne is the leader of the rebels and he believes the the Reeves character is \"the One.\" I thoroughly enjoyed it but would have like a little more creative final scene. Too many shell casings. Apparently, weaponry didn't advance much in twenty years. But, it keeps one on edge with its special effects and its non-stop action."

            "Review": "Man, I can not get this film out of my head. It is so rare that a movie can affect me the way \"The Pianst\" did. The last movie that did that was \"Casino\". I was really tired when I was watching the movie. It was almost midnight, so I was thinking that I'll start watching and I'll finish it in the morning. Did I? No, indeed I did not stop watching. I couldn't stop it. I just wanted to see what would happen next. I cried during \"Schindler's List\", I sobbed in this film. Everything that happens in this film is so sad. Adrien Brody does a remarkable job of acting in this film. I would very highly recommend this film. Especially if you are a history buff. Please, I think this film should be in the top 10 best films of all time.I looked on the message boards you know and some other user comments that didn't enjoy this film much, they criticized Adrien Brody's performance and say that he was boring and only showed emotions that are easy to act. Please, you have got to be kidding me. This man portrayed the total feeling of hopelessness, being alone, being hated. I one time had an audition in high school like this to see if I could improvise, and the way I imagined this feeling is like in dodgeball where you have no one else on your team and you're the only one left standing, yet on the other team there is 20 big men that are just waiting to wack that ball at you. Adrien couldn't have done a better job, I was so frightened for him and cried for him during the whole film while he was one the run.Roman Polanski as the director, he himself escaped the terrors of being a prisoner in The Holocaust, yet he lost his mother and other family members. Yes, I'm sure this film must have been hard to re create for him, but he was probably the only director that could have done this movie as brilliantly as he did. He created this story and made it so effective, I called up my mom and told her that I loved her so much because we take so many things for granted. True, this isn't the 1930's or 40's, and we are in America. But it's still frightening to think that human beings are capable of that much hate and being so brutal to another human. World War II is one of the most frightening wars in history, if you read more about The Holocaust, you get more into it and you should. If you are not interested, then watch this film. It's a must see, otherwise how else will we learn from our mistakes? The Pianist is a beautiful and extremely dark tale about a man and the struggle to survive. The ending is so powerful and moving to know that sometimes one man can make a difference in a crowd of so many and I'm not talking about Adrien Brody's character. You'll see what I mean.10/10"

In my opinion it is one of the finest depictions of the holocaust. This movie came close to Schindlers list in depicting the horrors of Holocaust. Brody puts in a marvelous and utterly touching performance. The story depicts the emotional and cultural breakdown of persecuted Jewish community as Nazi policy tightens around them. Excellent acting by Brody."

            "Review": "The Pianist is the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, at the time Poland's most acclaimed pianist whose life is transformed during the Nazi occupation of Warsaw beginning in 1939.  The film spans several years and maps his many personal trials in addition to providing the perspectives of his family, rebel factions and sympathizers.Brilliantly directed by Roman Polanski and starring an amazing Adrien Brody, The Pianist is bound to garner comparisons to Schindler's List, for obvious reasons.  However similar the subject matter, the approach is different. While Schindler's List was filmed in a beautiful, crisp black and white that offered many incredible images, The Pianist was filmed with almost muted color.  Schindler's List featured what has been argued as a complicated hero.  Oskar Schindler did save many Jews, but not without battling his own materialistic demons first.  The Pianist's Szpilman is a sympathetic character throughout.  His plight was desperate, and the demons he fought were over his own guilt in surviving a fight that eventually turns into a primal will to live.Polanski does not spare the viewer any grief with his film.  The horrific scenes between the Nazis and the Warsaw Jews were more terrifying and horrible than any horror/suspense movie I have seen in some time, possibly ever.  The humiliation and complete loss is wrenching.  In several scenes, Jews are lined up in the middle of the night and subjected to either torture or death.  In one case, a woman asks of a Nazi officer, \"What will happen to us?\" and is promptly shot point blank in the head.  The camera does not flinch or subdue any of these atrocities.A mention must be made of Brody's performance.  Having only previously seen Brody in two other films, Spike Lee's \"Summer of Sam\" and Terrence Malick's \"The Thin Red Line\" (a part that was supposed to be his launch into stardom before his part was unfortunately cut drastically) I knew his potential was great.  After his Oscar win, I viewed this movie with more criticism than I normally would have and he certainly did not disappoint.  He transcended my expectations.  His physical transformation was amazing, but more importantly, he conveyed the sorrow of this man shockingly well - in both verbal and non-verbal contexts.  It will be very interesting to see what kind of opportunities this role will afford him, and the kinds of roles he will accept.Something worth mentioning is the affect this movie had on the audience with whom I viewed this film.  Normally, when a film ends, the regular hardcore filmsters like myself will stay and watch the credits in their entirety. The rest of the audience stands up and leaves, usually to the chagrin of the remaining enthusiasts.  This was one of the few times I have seen a film at a theater where not one person stood to leave during the final credits. It wasn't until the house lights came up at the end did people begin to disperse.  Personally, I hightailed it out of the theater the second the lights came on because not only was my face a mess from crying during the film (Tammy Faye comes to mind) but I had this overwhelming need for an emotional release, so when I reached my car I sat and wept for about five minutes.  It has been years since I have watched a film that upset me to that extent. Conversely, while discussing this film with my brother, (someone who loves movies as much and has similar tastes as I do) he mentioned that while he thought the movie was excellent, he wasn't as profoundly emotionally effected as I was.  After thinking about this for a couple of days, I realized the difference: The music.  As a classical music enthusiast and erstwhile musician, the thought of not being able to enjoy, much less play the music you love is a tragic one.  Then the emotional outpouring that comes when you return to it - there aren't words to describe how intense that is.  Not having the same appreciation for this musical genre, one will be able to sympathize with the physical and emotional tribulations, but perhaps not in the musical sense.The Pianist was truly an astonishing film.  I was riveted from start to finish and so emotionally affected that I couldn't even consider writing a review until a week later.  Having said that, I am filing this away with my list of movies which include Schindlers List and Philadelphia, as films that I love but cannot rewatch for a long time after due to their intensely emotional content.--Shelly"

            "Review": "The Pianist is an incredible film in many aspects. Roman Polanski's account of the survival of the pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, is a document about how one man can overcome the worst possible situations in a world gone completely mad around him.The only fault one can find with the adaptation of Mr. Szpilman's story by playwright Ronald Harwood, is the fact that we never get to know the real Wladyslaw Szpilman, the man, as some of the comments made to this forum also have indicated.There is a very interesting point raised by the the pianist's father who upon reading something in the paper, comments about how the Americans have forgotten them. Well, not only the Americans, but the rest of the world would not raise a finger to do anything for the people that were being imprisoned and made to live in the confined area of Warsaw. The exterminating camps will come later. What is amazing in the film, is the frankness in which director Polanski portrays the duplicity of some Jews in the ghetto. The fact that Jews were used to control other Jews is mind boggling, but it was a fact, and it's treated here matter of factly. Had this been made by an American director, this aspect would have never surfaced at all. Yet, Mr. Polanski and Mr. Harewood show us that all was not as noble and dignified as some other films have treated this ugly side of war.  Wladyslaw Szpilman, as played by Adrien Brody, is puzzling sometimes, in that we never get to know what's in his mind. He's a man intent in not dying, but he's not a fighter. He accepts the kindness extended to him. He never offers to do anything other than keep on hiding, which is a human instinct. He will never fight side by side with the real heroes of the ghetto uprising. His role is simply to witness the battle from his vantage point in one of the safe houses across the street from where the action takes place.Adrien Brody is an interesting actor to watch. As the pianist of the story he exudes intelligence. There is a scene where Szpilman, in one of the safe houses he is taken, discovers an upright piano. One can see the music in his head and he can't contain himself in moving his fingers outside the closed instrument playing the glorious music from which he can only imagine what it will sound in his mind.The supporting cast is excellent. Frank Findlay, a magnificent English actor is the father of the pianist and Maureen Lipman, another veteran of the stage, plays the mother with refined dignity.In watching this film one can only shudder at the thought of another conflict that is currently brewing in front of our eyes. We wonder if the leaders of the different factions could be made to sit through a showing of The Pianist to make them realize that war is hell."

            "Review": "Fortunately, I'm able to keep my personal feelings about Roman Polanski compartmentalized enough to say that this was a remarkable film. I've read many comparisons between \"The Pianist\" and \"Schindler's List\" on this board, and even though the films are quite different, the overpowering portrayals of Man's inhumanity against Man will leave the viewer forever affected. Adrien Brody's Best Actor award was stunningly achieved here, as his character arcs through an incredible series of circumstances to barely survive life in the Warsaw Ghetto during World War II. What little I knew of director Polanski outside of his marriage to Sharon Tate, the grisly Manson murders, and his rape conviction in the late 1970's, was put into an entirely different perspective when I learned about his own life in the Polish Ghetto. Much of what we see in the film must emanate from his own unique experience as a child during the War and experiencing Nazi atrocity first hand. I don't envy anyone who survived that experience enduring the painful daily memories of those times.Given the film's title, I guess I was somewhat surprised by the paucity of musical sequences, though what was offered was artistically presented. Particularly poignant was the scene when Wladyslaw Szpilman (Brody) was left to hide in an apartment where a piano was available, and he mimed his way through a selection from memory by the need to maintain silence.Many years following the end of World War II, a single film cannister simply marked \"The Ghetto\" was discovered, revealing valuable insight into how the Nazi propaganda machine attempted to manipulate public opinion about 'rich' Jews who lived in luxury alongside fellow Jews in squalid conditions. Even more intimate details of life in the Warsaw Ghetto are presented in \"Shtikat Haarchion\" (A Film Unfinished), describing conditions that are even more horrific than those depicted in \"The Pianist\" or \"Schindler's List\", if that can even be imagined. These movies exist for a higher calling as a constant reminder that the term \"Never Again\" be one to constantly take seriously in an ever increasingly dangerous world."

            "Review": "The Pianist tells the story of such a man in war time Poland, played by Adrien Brody, who from start to finish sees his life literally getting worse and worse and worse- starts off with new rules from the Nazis, then the stars on the arms, followed by the Warsaw ghetto, and while there he could play in the restaurant, that too soon ended, as the trains arrived and took his family and anyone else he knew away.  During this he narrowly escapes, and from then on the film in a sense almost becomes not exactly a holocaust film, but more like a cross of that as the element and the basic structure of something a-la in Cast Away: this includes stretches of scenes showing Brody simply trying to keep out of view of the Germans, either in a small apartment provided by helpful Polish Christians/Jewish resistance, or as a scavenger in the abandoned sections of the ghetto, all while feeling the old rhythm of the piano in his head and fingertips.  This is the kind of magnificent filmmaking that shows a director not only being as true to the story given to him (that of Painist Szpilman, based on his autobiography) but to his past as well- Roman Polanksi faced similar conditions as a boy in the early 40's, and has found the best line to show, never crossed or mis-stepped, in representing the characters and the period. There aren't any hints of tightened suspense, no clues as to where the film could veer to, it just is.  The big difference to be seen between a film like this and Schindler's List is not just in the people and situations (Schindler's List was a film about two people, Schindler and Goeth, in the foreground while the Pianist is a total first person tale), yet also in the filmmaking qualities being here surely European.  And while the accents on the Polish-Jewish actors sounds a bit too British, that is quite forgivable considering the scope of the project (thank heavens he didn't put in English speaking Germans).In conclusion, Brody turns in a superb performance, and this indeed is in with Polanski's best, a deserved of 2002's Palme D'Or.  Great music too. A+"

            "Review": "This wrenching yet ultimately uplifting fact-based drama won Adrien Brody his Academy Award and finally made him a star (along with his gracious yet heartfelt Oscar speech and That Kiss :-) -- rightly so, since title character Wladyslaw Szpilman is a challenging role in so many ways!  It's not easy to command the screen when your character often has to be passive, deliberately trying not to draw attention to himself to keep from falling into Nazi hands in war-torn Poland, but Brody pulls it off.  It helps that Brody is absolutely stellar at acting with his eyes, plus his body language speaks volumes; these fill in the emotional cracks, especially in scenes where Szpilman, alone and in hiding, can't speak or even move around much for fear of giving himself away.  (Brody is the youngest actor to date to win the Best Actor Oscar, BTW, having gotten his little gold man only a month before his 30th birthday.) While there's no lack of haunting scenes, thanks to the deservedly Oscar-winning work of director Roman Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwood, the one that always gets me is the one where Szpilman discovers the apartment serving as his latest `safe house' has a piano. We see Szpilman sit at the piano; we see him in a head-and-shoulders shot, shoulders moving; we hear piano music and gasp as we fear his love and longing for music is about to give him away -- and then we see his hands moving in the air just above the keyboard and realize, with both relief and a pang of regret, that the music is only in Szpilman's head.  Terrific as the other 2002 Best Actor nominees were, now that I've seen THE PIANIST (as well as the fascinating making-of documentary on the DVD's flip side, showing what a physically and emotionally grueling experience Brody's job often was), I'd be really p***ed off if anybody but Adrien Brody had won! (Besides, the rest of the 2002 Best Actor nominees already won Oscars -- this time it was dark horse Brody's turn! :-)"

            "Review": "'The Pianist' is definitively an inspiring epic that celebrates the tenacity and fortitude of the human spirit... It is a remarkable tale of human survival sensitively brought to life by Polanski... The film carries us to the horrible reign of terror, where condemned people wearing the emblem of humiliation and oppression, are deprived of their rights, their human values and dignity, before being shipped to 'labor camps.' In Polanski's movie all the conventional elements of the drama are at peaks of excellence: Family union: When a father has to bargain to buy a single piece of caramel and divide it in six pieces to share it with each member of his family...Starvation: When a ghetto inhabitant assaults a helpless woman for a bowl of soup... Confusion: When a distraught woman wails on a platform because she smothered the cries of her baby with her hand...Love: When a young musician turns to his younger sister and utters with sad regret, \"I wish I knew you better.\" Survival: When one man observes the war through his hide-outs around the city...Cruelty: When an old man in a wheelchair is thrown off the balcony by the Nazis because he failed to stand upon their entrance...Fear: When a talented musician sits down at the old piano, and pretends to play his music, keeping his fingers flowing with control above the vertical ivories...Discrimination: When bored Nazi guards entertain themselves by forcing grotesquely mismatched old and sick couples to dance to a Jewish street band by the ghetto gate...Horror: When condemned Jewish workers lie face-down in the street, while one SS guard walks down the line, shooting without remorse each one in the back of the head... Isolation: When a fugitive emerges from his harrowing hiding place and walks through a field of deserted ruins exactly like the last man alive on Polish soil..Adrien Brody gives an absolutely moving performance (based on descriptive facial expressions) as the Polish composer and pianist who stays alive as a Jew, and remains true to his ideals... Brody captures the character's desperation, his anger and grief, his willpower and perseverance, his passion and love of music... Polanski gives us the chance to better know his shock and disbelief, his ordeal and tragedy, his hope for fairness and humanity...Nominated for seven Academy Awards, this captivating drama went on to win three Oscars, including Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay... Once Brody took the stage to accept his Oscar, he was so overwhelmed with happiness, that he swept the gorgeous Academy Award-winning Halle Berry off her feet with a long, steamy kiss..."

            "Review": "I remember seeing \"Schindler's list\" about ten years ago, and I remember how weird I felt for being almost completely unmoved by it. Although it showed the horrors of holocaust quite realistically, somehow it all seemed just a bit too fake and exaggerated. Characters were a bit off (I still can't decide who was more over the top, Schindler or Goeth), fake sentimentalism was all over the place, . While it was a work of art and an important reminder of true events that shouldn't be forgotten, on emotional level it just somehow failed to deliver.Enter \"The Pianist\". With no Spielberg around to put his trademark sappy material, we finally have a movie that shows the true horror and tragedy of Jewish people in World War II. The story is told through the eyes of one man - Wladislaw Szpielman, Jewish pianist who works in a radio station in Warsaw during the German occupation of Poland. Together with him we watch his world getting torn apart, witness his family being taken away, his existence being reduced to bare essentials. Brody gives a subtle yet spectacular performance, his best work yet. And never once are we reminded that we are watching a movie. Everything is shown from Szpielman's point of view, and it is all very gritty and realistic. While Spielberg's rendition of German atrocities always had a slightly staged feel to augment their dramatic purpose, here they are so true to life there impact is much greater - you watch and are being reminded in horror that this things actually happened.While being very hard to watch sometimes, this is a movie that \"Schindler's List\" was supposed to be. This movie doesn't judge anybody, or tries to explain anything - it shows historical events as a reflection of one man's fate, making a powerful testimony that stays with you long after the beautiful last shot and the end credits are over."

            "Review": "The Pianist is an account of the true life experience of a Polish pianist during WW2, in the context of the deportation of the Jewish community to the Ghetto of Warsaw, a setting virtually absent from all films inspired on WW2.\nPolanski (himself a child survivor of the Krakow and Warsaw ghettos) could have described in more detail the legendary, desperate fighting of the Jewish resistance in the ghetto of Warsaw, or the horrific mass extermination in concentration camps. Instead, the film gains in intensity by displaying the war from the pianist's own point of view (through windows, half-opened doors, holes in the walls - with big emphasis on the use of \"point of view shooting\" by the cameraman). One cannot help feeling disturbed by the most enthralling scenes of the film, as the isolated pianist tries to ensure his survival in the ghetto and ruins of Warsaw, hiding and fleeing, moving from one bombed house to the next, gradually becoming a shadow of his former self, hungry and afraid (merit largely attributed to the extraordinary performance by Adrien Brody, who visibly loses half of his weight throughout the film).Does the pianist raise any sympathy from the audience? Not immediately, in my view. The pianist is more than often a drifting character, almost a witness of other people's and his own horrors. He seems to float and drift along the film like a lost feather, with people quickly appearing and disappearing from his life, some helping generously, others taking advantage of his quiet despair, always maintaining an almost blank, dispassionate demeanour. One may even wonder why we should care in the least about this character. But we do care. That is, I believe, the secret to this film's poetry.In one of the strongest scenes, towards the end, a German officer forces the pianist to play for his life, in an episode that suddenly brings a much lighter, beautifully poetic shade to the film (this German officer will be probably compared to Schindler, although his philanthropy does not quite share the same basis).This is also a wonderful tribute to Polish artists, through Chopin's music, with the concert at the very end of the film and the opening performance by the pianist at the local radio station (with the sound of bomb explosions in the background) forming an harmonious link between the beginning and end of the film (following Polanski's usual story-frame).Overall, The Pianist is one of the most detailed and shocking accounts of the treatment of the Jews by the Nazis, with the atmosphere in Warsaw well captured and believable. Quite possibly, The Pianist will remain in the history of film-making as the most touching and realistic portraits of the holocaust ever made.Polanski's film deserves a strong presence in the 2003 Oscar nominations, including a nomination for Adrien Brody's amazing performance, Polanski's sublime direction, best adapted screenplay and, obviously, best picture. This could be, at last, Polanski's long awaited, triumphal comeback to the high and mighty Hollywood."

            "Review": "There have been so many fine films that deal with the Holocaust. Each shows the atrocities of the Germans, their random cruelty, their ruthlessness. This film has all that, but it also has Adrien Brody. This is a film that gets us inside the human being, the person who must run, whose iron will propels him forward. The thing is, though, he is not necessarily a hero in the traditional sense. We sense the fatigue of his character as he runs from situation to situation, just trying to stay alive. There are good people around him, many are good Germans. While we watch people shot in the head, beaten to the ground, mutilated, we see him moving aimlessly toward something (the thing is we don't know what that something is). He hears rumors about the Russians liberating Poland but he can't let up for a second. He watches as the underground makes sacrifice after sacrifice, their building burned, their people sent up in flames. He sees himself as a coward. He thinks about being dead, but his will to live drives him on. The title, of course, is him--the pianist--a nationally known classical pianist, suddenly dehumanized. We see his weaknesses and his strengths. We also get a more balanced though terrifying view of the situation in the Polish ghetto. This is a film we should all see."

            "Review": "THE PIANIST is a film that takes a dark and disturbing subject matter - the persecution of the Warsaw Jews by Nazis in the Second World War - and turns it into a spellbinding, enthralling journey of a movie. Roman Polanski could easily have made this maudlin and sentimental like Spielberg's SCHINDLER'S LIST, but he thankfully avoids that temptation and the result is the much better movie of the two.This film contains a documentary-style realism in its depiction of the various atrocities carried out by the uncaring Germans. It gets dark and darker as it goes on, and yet the viewer is unable to tear his eyes off the screen because it's all so well-realised and realistic. Adrien Brody plays the eyes and ears of the viewer in a subdued manner, yet delivers his greatest and most believable performance as a result. The story has a lot of darkness and violence, but Polanski's expert camera-work and endless style stops the subject matter ever becoming depressing; instead there's enough tension to keep you involved and wanting to find out what's next. Things build to a suitably touching and poignant climax that doesn't disappoint."

The movie begins in 1939 and ends some time after 1945, which means we get to experience some of the significant events that took place in Warzaw doing WW2!The movie throws a lot og haunting imagery at you, moments that are impossible to erase from your memory ever again! Its brutal and it does not shy away from the dark stuff, giving an authentic experience!It is a movie i can highly recommrnd even if it is too dark and depressing to come back too!"

            "Review": "Polanski has depicted the gory details of the holocaust without much restraint. But, the most wonderful aspect of the film is that the director has not lost focus of his story and instead of focusing too much on the holocaust horror he has weaved the true-life narrative of survival around devillish happenings.Every single act of escapade Szpilman goes through is depicted like a drop of water on a barren desert. However, the Oasis in the driest desert comes in the end and it is here that Polanski captures the essence of human emotion. I had this very strong urge of jumping into the theater screen and magically adopting a character in the movie and doing something about the helplesness portrayed so convincingly.Overall, Polanski has given a stunning visual narrative of the cold war. Survival indeed is a privilege though it is taken for granted today. Performances by Brody, Kretschmann deserve applause.Pawel Edelman's camera work is moving and he has brilliantly captured the dark sadness in the visual canvas in an effective way. The lighting is amazing. Pre-dawn shooting schedule could have helped a great deal.Herv\u00e9 de Luze's editing work has ensured that the narrative does not slip away from focus. Most notable is the scene where the human bodies are lit on fire and the camera raises to show the smoke. The darkness of the smoke is enhanced and is used effectively to fade the scene out.The scene where Brody's fingers move as he rests his hands on the bars of the tram handle only goes to show the brilliance of Polanski as a film-maker.Great film that will be in the running for this year's Oscars. I will give it a 9 Out of 10."

            "Review": "Film makers have to step carefully when dealing with issues like the Nazi extermination program. There have been equally brutal programs of ethnic cleansing in places like Southeast Asia and Rwanda, in which hundreds of millions died, but nothing like this in Europe since the Middle Ages. The victims here were not only Jews but Gypsies, the mentally ill, homosexuals, socialists, communists, and political undesirables. The Nazis eliminated not six million but some uncountable number between 12 and 15 million. An event like that can't be treated lightly and milked for easy tears, or the event itself is cheapened.Fortunately, the films that have explored the subject have been uniformly well done, as Roman Polanski's \"The Pianist\" is well done. Polanski himself suffered in much the same way as the protagonist, Vlad Szpilman (Adrien Brody). Polanski has a habit of embellishing his tales but there's no question that in this instance he knows what he's talking about.Szpilman is a well-known young pianist on Warsaw radio but the German occupation puts the station out of business. He and his family are herded into the Warsaw ghetto where they are subject to constant abuse and occasional murder. Szpilman barely escapes being sent to Treblinka with the rest of his family. And for the last half of the film, with the help of some friends who endanger themselves by lending him aid, he scuttles rat-like from one hiding place to another, each more dismal and perilous than the last. He suffers jaundice, his hair and beard grow long, his clothes turn to tatters, his food disappears, he's half frozen, and he seems to shrink.He's reduced to living in the attic of a nearly demolished apartment building and is ecstatic to discover a gallon can of pickles overlooked on the top shelf of a kitchen cabinet. The can falls out of his hands while he tries to open it and rolls across the floor to come to rest at the boots of a German officer, Captain Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann). The only Germans we've seen so far have been brutes -- ridiculing the insane, executing Jews who ask simple questions, or simply shooting people chosen at random.We expect nothing from Hosenfeld except a quick shooting. But Hosenfeld is a human being and, having discovered that Szpilman \"is\" -- or rather \"was\" -- a pianist, he asks him to play a piano left in one of the flats. Szpliman has been unable to play for years and when he seats himself we worry that he might not bring it off and, indeed, his first chords are tentative, uncertain. Then his playing becomes automated, the old habits return, and he dashes off a dramatic and exquisitely executed piece of Chopin. Hosenfeld has been leaning back, enjoying the music, then leaves Szpilman quietly to his attic. He returns a few times later, before the Germans withdraw before the Russians, and unceremoniously hands him a few packages of food and, finally, his overcoat. The matter-of-fact compassion shown by Hosenfeld, and Szpilman's desperate need for contact with another human, are very moving.When the Russian troops finally arrive, Szpilman stumbles out of his hovel to greet them, but seeing his overcoat the Russians open fire on him. Szpilman finally convinces them that he is a Pole, not a German, and one of the befuddled soldiers asks, \"Then why the ****ing coat?\" Szpilman is trembling with fear but manages to gulp, \"I was cold.\" An epilogue tells us that Szpilman went on with his career and Hosenfeld wound up in a Soviet prison camp where he died in 1952, despite Szpilman's attempt to find him. Under the end credits, a smiling Szpilman plays a lively, sparkling composition by Chopin.It's a remarkable film. Polanski is no longer the Wunderkind but a mature film maker. Nothing is excessive. We need only as much as we need to know to understand Szpilman's travails -- one tragedy following another. There are no sentimental speeches at the final parting of Szpilman and his family. Szpilman himself never breaks down. He simply does what needs to be done to survive. And Adrien Brody captures what Szpilman must have been like. (From some angles he resembles the young Arthur Rubenstein.) Kretschmann gets Hosenfeld down pat as well. In their scenes together we sense their respective positions -- one man with nothing left to lose, the other with nothing left to gain. The story, and the historical facts it's based on, raise many questions about human nature, of course. I'm not at all sure that if we could find the answers to those questions we would like what we found.One of the better films of the year."

I guess it's cause I was expecting a phenomenal and amazing movie, but what I got was a pretty good movie. It just wasn't as powerful or compelling as I thought it would be. Adrien Brody was almost perfect for this role, his transition from being a prideful musician to a broken down man was done really well. This film just wasn't all that challenging, the plot is basically based on a true story of W\u0142adys\u0142aw Szpilman(Adrien Brody). And his struggle to survive during the Holocaust. The thing is the whole thing seems a bit conventional a lot of aspect of this movie just seemed to narrow at times and straightforward which isn't necessarily a good thing and lack depth. The film also seemed to drag a bit because of the direction it kept going, it's a good movie and I agree with some of the positive feedback this film has been getting. It just isn't a powerful or amazing film I was looking forward to seeing, not one of those movies I feel I need to see again someday after it's finished. It really isn't a masterpiece like come critics claim it to be.7.8/10"

Neither of us had any expectations and figured if it won a couple of Oscars it must be decent. I had no idea it was an absolute masterpiece. This may be one of the best movies I have seen to date. Days after I saw this movie I cannot stop visualizing the images and feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. The cinematography is breathtaking. The beauty of pre-devastation Warsaw is sharply contrasted with the bleakness of the ghetto, and it would be understatement to say how haunting the visuals of Warsaw after the bombings were. The acting here is tremendous. Brody (who I had really not seen in anything else significant prior to this) carries the entire movie on his wan shoulders. He conveys so much with pain, anguish, hope, and loss with just his eyes. It is quite the actor who causes the viewer to feel the pain he is experiencing as a character. This was an extremely well deserved acting Oscar.This movie is extremely depressing considering the subject matter but it is told and portrayed with grace and power by Polanski. So many scenes are powerful and haunting. To me, in many ways this is a perfect movie. Yes, I know this review is filled with hyperbole, but I simply cannot remember the last time I was so moved and impressed by a film as I was with the Pianist. See it at least once."

You see the violence ramp up as the film progresses.It's an incredibly well made film, it looks terrific, people look very much of that time, surely a consideration the casting director used.Several things that always stayed with me, someone begging with a corpse laying on the ground that was one moment, another being the elderly man in the wheelchair, harrowing sequences.I thought Adrien Brody was excellent as Szpillman, a very understated performance, totally sincere, incredibly believable. Ed Stoppard, Frank Findlay, Maureen Lipman and others all so good.It's a long film, but incredibly rewarding.10/10."

The storyline follows a planet eater out for a stone that will allow him to travel throughout space and time to find planets to consume. The ancient animal transformers protect the stone and have traveled to Earth to hide themselves and the stone. When autobots that support the planet eater arrive on Earth to find the stone the transformers and animal transformers will need to work together to protect the stone.This movie is directed by Steven Caple Jr. (Creed II) and stars Anthony Ramos (In the Heights), Dominique Fishback (Judas and the Black Messiah), Dean Scott Vazquez (In the Heights), Tobe Nwigwe (Mo) and Michael Kelly (Dawn of the Dead).This storyline was really compelling and interesting. It was tremendous watching the animal and car transformer worlds combine. The CGI and special effects were outstanding and every action scene is a 10/10. I really adored every fight. However, we didn't need the humans in this at all, and the action, dialogue and plot points involving Ramos and Fishback were painful. They are good actors whose performances weren't good here and felt out of place. It's time to move on from the humans needing to be the heroes in these storylines...because the Transformers, both good guys and bad guys, were awesome.Overall, this is a worthwhile addition to the Transformers series that I would strongly recommend. I would score this a 6/10."

It is unfortunately a rather drab affair.Within about 5 minutes every cliche possible is ticked off the list. The dialogue is grating and so corny it hurts. The action is messy and disorienting. The newly introduced 'Maximals' are severely wasted with limited screen time. The plot centres around a silly doohickey that is hard to care about. The human characters are kind of annoying and poorly written. None of the humour really lands and neither do any of the emotional story beats. The story sags a little in the middle. I could go on.Saying all that, this film is mildly entertaining and does have its moments, although they are too few and far between. I guess it's worth watching if you are into your Transformers films, but the casual movie goer should probably save their money and skip this one."

Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is one of those many examples that raise one question: where are the talents and the creative people these days? Certainly not too many are involved in the movie business - Rise of the Beasts got nothing that will raise it above the bar of barely acceptable: a dead boring story line, dead boring characters, and terrible dialogues we listened to one million times before. The special effects are somewhat okay, but, well, that's pretty standard these days. Recommendation only for the absolute hardcore fan of the Transformer universe or for those who are - for whatever reason - in need for some brain killing experience."

            "Review": "This movie is basically an ethnic version of the other Transformer movies. Nary a white face in sight anywhere..That said, it sucks. It's really the same story as the others and a rip of af the Avengers with a \"key\" replacing the gems on a glove.It's derivitive and boring. Really poorly directed.It's set in 1994, but somehow all the transformers are more advanced than the later movies set in current times. How does that work out?If you saw any of the other transformer movies you don't need to see this one. In fact, you shouldnt see this one because it's the worst of the bunch and you'll really feel bad afterwards."

The 2 (unknown) leading actors for sure arent terrible, but they sure as heck arent able to carry this movie by themselves either. Bummer.More bad: what about the thrill and spectactle? This movie is severely lacking in real thrill and spark! I mean after 30 minutes I already got bored watching this movie. And getting bored is the last thing I desire when watching an action movie for petes sake!Not any good then? It'll do for the masses, but be sure to bring along a lot of popcorn though, because any junkfood you will eat, will guaranteed give you more satisfaction than watching this mediocre franchise edition."

Or is that just how much more derivative this film is now?Movie starts out ok. Gets interesting till you meet the gorilla. Is an absolute slog for the next hour. Wraps up with an \"uh ok?\" And the random post-credits scene which was not actually post-credits. Seems director over here figured nobody gave enough a crap to stay past the credits for one.So formulaic. From the girls plot armor to the now typecast optimus prime. Also too much filler. Of all the films. This one had like ZERO reason to be longer than 1hr 30mins. Seriously dumb.Only exception was noah and the kid. Noth were decent. But the girl and the one dimensional transformers? Apart from mirage..The jumpscare devilbotthingies were so annoying..too much filler. Is this a horror flick yet?Why is the transformers villains teeth so rusty? Someone of his leadership and caliber is not going to rock some homeless teeth. Hes either going to have perfect optimus teeth or none. Totally took me out of his perfectly delivered lines.Some of the cgi is just bad. A lot of it.I will rewatch at my own pace just to slam it more."

And then Mirage the autobot mercilessly killing white cops in the car chase.Then the Spanish transformer, and the Latino character is like \"Wow your spanish\" and the Spanish transformer replies \"That's racist...\" like omg... what is wrong with these writers?And the two human hero's go into a tomb and they say: \"This is some indiana jones stuff\" and it just reads like the writers thought \"Lets have an indiana jones style section\" and then they comment on their own ideas in the script. So 4th wall breaking, but NOT in a good way.At this point, I think a large section of Hollywood is just a rich club of nepo-babies without a single shred of talent, who are totally obsessed with shoving modern politics into everything. Like seriously, get some original ideas, and get a life. ( and I'm saying that as a Left Wing guy - but what do these issues have to do with Transformers??? )No thank you. Skip the film for sure."

            "Review": "I appreciated the fact that this film made Optimus Prime an actual character, and that it found a couple of interesting, believable ways to give the human characters a legitimate use in the story.Aside from a few moments involving these things, I was bored senseless by this movie.I struggle to comprehend how a script like this passes so many hands and makes it to production; it has some of the worst dialogue this side of Attack of the Clones.Everything in this movie is told to us, rather than creatively shown. It's obnoxious, it's lazy, and it's stupid. It treats us, the audience, like we're stupid as it spoon feeds every piece of information to us like we're infants, even though the story is really simple and nothing original or complex happens once.All this could be saved if the action were entertaining and investing. But it isn't, aside from a handful of stylish shots.Say what you will about Michael Bay's movies. (They're bad.) But at least they had huge scale to them and the stakes were understood.This is a bland blockbuster movie, through and through. The action never features any destruction or threat to human life. There isn't a practical, real thing happening on screen.Artificial, boring, and derivative, with about 5-10 minutes worth of good material.I thought Bumblebee was a bright spot, but it looks like the good streak has been cut short."

Sadly, I guess it could work but man, how lazy.I guess it might work for teenage boys filled with testosterone, can't really se who else this is marketed to."

            "Review": "\"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" is the new movie based on the Takara toys that Hasbro exploited and have been brought to television, movies and comics. In this new film, the result is kind of almost bad, a soulless and simple script that could have been told in 90 minutes and not in an excessive length of 127 minutes that become slow. The performances are ordinary and the director's work does not stand out. The production is not used, the soundtrack has no essence and the cinematography is quite conventional. The biggest negative point is the costume design and the setting, since the film takes place during 1994 and fails to take us to that year, with the exception of some retro objects and extras that wear 90s costumes, the protagonists really look very 2020's. Another flaw is the digital special effects that fail to be entirely realistic, the green screen and After Effects giving themselves away for much of the length of the film. A totally forgettable production."

I must admit, though, this film looked surprisingly good in 3D.Overall this film is very forgettable and doesn't do anything new. Also, with an ending that leaves me with more questions and thoughts of why, then necessary really brings everything down.Suffice it to say I still prefer Michael Bays Transformers. They're better, in my opinion. (I said it, deal with it)PS. As the movie drew to a close, one audience member gave a loud clap. I immediately thought well I'm glad someone here enjoyed this film.IMDb: 3/10\nLetterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters."

I don't know who wrote the script, but it was awful also. Nothing against the actors, but some of them seem so miscast in their roles. The girls voice was absolutely annoying. Sometimes over acting, sometimes not acting at all. But all in all just terrible. Sometimes great dialogue can say bad acting, in this case, the dialogue was just as bad. Cringe worthy. I was hoping for more as I love the transformers movies. I wanted to stop watching within the first 15 minutes, but I also wanted to give it a chance to see if it would get better. It didn't. If this is the best they've got they should stop now."

WRONG!Generic storyline, dull dialogue, even the effects felt so devoid of any coolness, man back in 2007 transformations were SICK! Now its just some flexible metal mumbo jumbo, whatever costs less I figure.I really tried to enjoy it but I could not, I didn't to expect to dislike it sthis much, I guess in some way it's a cool for kids; YAY ROBOTS! Big monke robot punches the bad guy, the gud guys run, oh no! We have to stop big bad guy.The soundtrack is mid, oh and the way the story develops and the decisionmaking of the characters is pretty absurd.It might've just ruined transformers for me.Don't bother, go watch Spiderverse or Guardians of the galaxy 3 instead.Like, not even if you're a Transformers fan, matter of fact if you want to stay a Transformers fan definitely skip it."

Weak trying to pull in the 90's rap to pander harder. The \"main\" actor is just terrible. The subplot (aka the actual Transformers) is tired and been done on numerous occasions. The Transformers are only in name only, nothing resembling their real personas. Again, skip this one. Let it go away. This was made for reviewers on youtube who get free stuff. If you like this... watch the 80's film to see how it really is done."

            "Review": "In a lot of ways I may be the demographic for Transformer movies. Since I am the generation to which the original 80's toys were marketed to. Also, having this take place in 1994 was when I was right out of high school and wanted to reminisce about those days.Seeing Optimus Prime always gave me a sense of courage. Because his belief in saving worlds went above and beyond what was required. A hero in many ways.This story attempts to shoehorn the cartoon movie which the Autobots are trying to find a way home.Unfortunately, the story centers around a Hispanic post-teen dude who has one of the most obnoxious Brooklyn accent, it's hard to not root for his end. But, of course, they have to paint him to be the victim of society. Hard to believe they think he was a former solider. What the script fails miserably at, is that having courage doesn't mean you take revenge on the world by attempting to steal a fancy Porche 911.It wants you to like New Yorkers. But the rest of the country hates them. They're loudmouths who continue to be prideful and self-righteous entitled elitist who think middle America are behind in the times. Meanwhile, embraces self-destruction. Urban animals. If you are the minority who likes them, this movie is for you. It peppers itself with the typical tropes of city pride (\"Brooklyn!\") and wants you to do the same because it shows you the Twin Towers. Ugh. Millenials won't understand. Nor care.The worst part of this flick is that you pair this guy up with an equally obnoxious Pete Davidson as Mirage (wasn't this Jazz in the 80's?). His quips are cringey. It's that guy who thinks he's the funniest dude in the room.So the story is of a key that opens time portals for a planet eater Omnicron (from the 80's movie) to come to Earth to devour it. Why? Who knows. Because it's there? It doesn't gather much more energy from it that any other planet in the universe would have. So the stakes are hilariously massive. But that doesn't stop that New Yorker from trying to save this planet because...? His brother has sickle cell? Oof. Weak.What made the movie \"Bumblebee\" great is the innocence of the human characters. These \"street wise\" guys are annoying. So getting past that was a chore.With all the technology I saw being spun around in this flick, why can't they just re-make the 80's cartoon into a live action movie? BTW, the Spike suit makes an appearance here.Middling movie with nowhere to go."
